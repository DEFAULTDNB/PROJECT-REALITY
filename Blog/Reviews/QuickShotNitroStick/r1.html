	<h4>Who Doesn't Love a Bargain?</h4><hr>
	<p>When I saw the QuickShot NitroStick (yes that's what they called it!) for sale recently, at a ridiculously low price of just £5, I jumped at the opportunity to add to my selection of oddball N64 accessories.
	<p>QuickShot made a few accessories in their time and this was perhaps their most specialised piece of input equipment for the N64, specifically having been made for the controlling of aircraft. 
	I dont know if you know this but there are only a handful of "flight-sim" games on the Nintendo 64 including <i>Buck Bumble, Lylat Wars (Star Fox), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, AeroFighters Assault</i> and <i>Pilotwings</i>, so there isn't much to pick from!
	<p>The NitroStick has the Z-Trigger on the rear as you would imagine, the A and B buttons are up on the top of the stick along with a hat-switch that acts as the D-Pad. On your left-hand side are the C-buttons, the L/R triggers in button form and the start/turbo/reset buttons too. 
	Lastly, on the underside resides a switch that converts the input from analog to digital, so if a game requires D-pad input instead of stick input, you're sorted!
	<h4>It's Good, But Not Perfect</h4><hr>
	<p>QuickShot sadly didn't build this thing with games like <i>Lylat Wars</i> in mind, because the pew-pew button is not in the correct pace as you would hope, the Z-Trigger, its on the A button. You cant re-map the buttons either so it feels a little off, but on the other hand games like AeroFighters and even <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> utilise the Z-Trigger for your main guns and it feels superb!
	<p>Handling in-game feels nice, really nice, and the pitch and yaw of this stick really builds the immersion when playing games that best suit this equipment. In actual fact ANY game could theoretically be played with this controller, including <i>Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye,</i> or even <i>Zelda</i> if you REALLY wanted to, but I wouldn't. 
	Barring a couple of these fringe-case flight sims the NitroStick doesn't feel great for RPG/FPS/Platforming play, as the learning curve becomes huge, so stick to the perfectly formed trident-controller for those games!

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>It's not for everyone, nor is it for every game, but I kind of like Quickshot's quirky stab at a realistic flight stick.
