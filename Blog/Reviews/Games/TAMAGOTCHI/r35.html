	<h4>Virtual Pest</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>64 de Hakken! Tamagotchi Minna de Tamagotchi World</i> embodies the 90s. Who didn't have a virtual pet nagging them 24/7 for food, cleaning, or to play? Me, I never had one; I was a BMX kid. I was outside building ramps and hurting myself daily until the day I got my N64 anyway.</p>
	<p>This game starts by allowing you to pick between two evolution types. By selecting the checkered egg, you'll be playing through as the first generation of Tamagotchi, while choosing the plain eggs you'll be playing a slightly different game, with the second generation version, featuring new species. Either way, your LCD-based life form can grow from a baby to an adult with various character traits, such as healthy, average, or poor health, and hungry, happy, or sad.</p>
	<p>You initiate the game with a randomised play order, then roll a dice and move the relevant spaces. You each have 64 life points to work through, spending them on various tasks. Each turn you get to interact with your virtual pet, feeding, washing, playing, disciplining, or caring for it with medicine. Some of those options contain sub-options, with a variety of things to play or feed them with, for example.</p>
	<p>As you pick your course around the branching board, your Tamagotchi will indicate its current mood and will rely on you to provide it with what it needs. Landing on certain cards triggers a four-player mini-game; these are the most fun part of this game. The majority of the games are great!</p>
	<p>You have four gauges to maintain: health, exercise, discipline, and power. Filling your power bar to the max will trigger a growth spurt. You need four evolutions to achieve adulthood. Only the winning player's Tamagotchi will see its final form, and there are 59 characters to unlock!</p>

	<h4>Games Galore</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>64 Tamagotchi World</i> simulates the interactions of the 90s synthetic pocket pal perfectly. Playing minigames with your pet, on your turn, involves little games of chance such as picking a cup and seeing whats underneath, choosing a direction in an attempt to dodge a falling girder, or hammering buttons to try to stay on a treadmill.</p>
	<p>These are to satiate your Tamagotchi's need to play, and winning builds up your gauges, evolving your creature faster towards that trait. Landing on some tiles also triggers slot machine games, where you can wager points to gain more. The more points you have, the faster you'll evolve! Land on a bad tile and you'll lose points, stunting your efforts.</p>
	<p>The main games involve all four of you. I played several of the ten available, and they were really competitive. There was one where 16 cards are presented and you had to match the one specified the the top before your opponents. A really cool one had the four players on a picture of an N64 controller; a randomiser moves you onto a button, and then you have to press that button before the time runs out to get a point. There was another that had you navigating an electrified maze; if you touch a wall, you get sent right back to the beginning, but make it to the centre and you win points!</p>
	<p>Another mini-game sees you slinging poop at each other. The one with the least poop on them wins. It's absolutely bat-shit crazy, but my word, it's kind of fun!</p>

	<h4>Drop LCD & Party</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The entire game centres around your little digital buddy. As with real Tamagotchis, there is a chance you could mess up royally and it will die. If this happens, you're out!</p>
	<p>The nostalgia of hearing and interacting with a Tamagotchi in 2025 raises this game's cult coolness a few notches, even for someone like me who never had one. The piezo buzzer sounds, mixed with giggles or shrieks, are so reminiscent of a simpler time. I really enjoyed it.</p>
	<p>The game has its merits, lots of them, but it's not the best party game on the system, and with no translation patch available, it took a small amount of muddling through to figure out what to do for each game. Having said that, 64 Tamagotchi World is worth a look, especially if you have three friends willing to play.</p>
