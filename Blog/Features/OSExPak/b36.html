	<h4>Sourcy Schematics</h4>

	<p>Mason Stookbury over on <a href="https://github.com/MasonStooksbury/Open-Source-N64-Expansion-Pak?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">Github</a> completed their project several months ago, to create an open-source, DIY Expansion Pak for the N64!</p>
	<div class="quote">

		<p>Here are all the files you would need to create your own N64 Expansion Pak. All you would need to do is clone this repo, open the .kicad_pro file in KiCad 8.0, and you can poke around the files.</p>

	<p>With schematics and pin out diagrams to facilitate the production of these Paks, Mason has done a sterling job in researching and developing them for all to use as they wish.</p>  
	<p>What's interesting about this solution is that it still requires you to source two 2 MB RAMBUS chips (approximately £19.91 each), which will be soldered to the PCB. This could prove problematic due to these chips being quite hard to obtain nowadays. 30 years ago, these chips were all the rage but today, not so much. The result is that the average DIY build would come in costing roughly the same as it would to just buy an official Expansion Pak from a reasonable vendor (£30-40). If you were planning to buy and produce these in bulk, then the costing decreases a little, but not enough to make it a really appealing purchase, and not without you having to physically build and sell hundreds of these to turn over any sort of profit. It's a viscious cycle.</p>

	<h4>Expanding Horizons</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I definitely think it would be fantastic to have an open-source solution to replacing OEM parts, however, it has to be attainable and affordable. If not, then the project needs to be handled professionally by a group willing to buy in bulk, produce in bulk, and supply these for a reasonable price. There was talk of Mason starting a kickstarter to fund the torturous mass production of these, but whether or not that happens remains to be seen. I think the margins are far too tight on this one just now, even for the average hobbyist, but it is encouraging to find such N64 related projects scattered online nonetheless!</p>
	<p>Will Nintendo set in and C&D a project like this? It's doubtful. But then you can never put anything past Nintendo when it comes to protecting their IPs.</p>
