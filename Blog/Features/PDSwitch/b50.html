	<h4>Perfect Port</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following on from <a href="https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark" target="_blank">Fgsfdsfgs decompilation of Perfect Dark</a>, a newly compiled branch for Nintendo Switch NROs has been built to allow modders and homebrew enthusiasts to play the game natively on their hybrid portable consoles.</p>
	<p>Each version for PAL, NTSC-U, and NTSC-J is covered, with players only needing to put their ROM in the correct folder and name it correctly. For example, the NTSC-U V 1.1 ROM needs to be named "pd.ntsc-final.z64" and placed in the "perfectdark/data" folder.</p>
	<p>The initial footage surfaced on November 15th, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT_x8iwVi-w" target="_blank">Milenko's YouTube channel</a>, and demonstrated the ability to boot the game, play the single-player campaign, and get into simulant based multiplayer deathmatches.</p>

	<h4>Velvety Smooth</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you can see from the video, the game runs at silky smooth frame rates, even when surrounded by sims and gunfire in multiplayer matches. As the port progresses, it would be amazing to see things like custom levels and online multiplayer, which we know will trounce the performance of the official version of Perfect Dark that was recently released on the Nintendo Switch Online 18+ service.</p>
	<p>It's still early days yet, but for any players looking to set this up and bind the right stick to the C-Buttons for a more OG feeling set up, then please take a listen to what Fgsfdsfgs states here:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>You can do this. Extended -> Controller -> Player # -> disable Analog Movement. This will map right stick to the C-buttons. I don't remember if you can bind other buttons to stick directions though.
	You can also use N64 controller schemes. You might have to use "Reset to N64 defaults" in the key bindings menu after selecting them though.
	There's one other thing. I think by default the right and left stick might be swapped (i.e. left stick is movement/C-buttons, right is look/N64 stick) because you usually expect right stick to look. You can uncheck "Swap sticks" in the controller menu to revert that.
	</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>Currently, no mods or patched ROMs are compatible with the port, though Fgsfdsfgs has mentioned that they might make a launcher menu for the game, similar to that of GZDoom's.</p>
