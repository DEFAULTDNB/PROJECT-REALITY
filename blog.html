				<p>Today I would like to welcome none other than Graslu00 to this weeks ReCollect64 chat Q&A session! So without further adue, let's start by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media:</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm a YouTuber, focused mainly on classic N64 games, GoldenEye and James Bond in general. I like to share my gameplay and also help others with the games I cover or show them the best up-to-date ways to enjoy the classics.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My family got me into gaming and PC's in general - my dad would play on the N64 while giving me an unplugged controller as a kid (who didn't do this) and eventually I got old enough to give it a real go by myself. His favourites on N64 were GoldenEye, Donkey Kong 64 and Star Wars Racer. I've been involved with gaming since I have use of memory. My mom introduced me into PC's and that eventually lead into gaming there as well. It wasn't until the Xbox 360 that I got into online gaming however, Halo 3 was my first Xbox Live title back in January 2008 and that was a life changing moment which starting my online presence.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't exactly collect old games other than keeping the copies I've always had - I did expand a bit on those titles I was interested in and/or complete sets for a few pieces. For N64 and GameCube.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The Nintendo 64 would be my favourite console - it's the one I still use to this day and enjoy the most, but if I had to choose one other than that it'd be the Xbox 360 for the reasons I mentioned earlier.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Outside of my YouTube work which includes playing GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and other Bond titles, I focus on multiplayer games mainly. These days I'm mostly just hopping between Fortnite, Counter-Strike and an indie game called Friends vs Friends - but in general I play a huge variety of titles. Metroid, Tekken, Resident Evil, Zelda... But I'm definitely more of a competitive player, I've had some good competitions, tournaments and leagues on my back by now.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Chocolate.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I own a signed copy of GoldenEye & Perfect Dark by the developers that I've met multiple times in the UK. Always a great experience to meet them and share some time together. The Rareware devs really are down to earth!</p></div>				
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Some day I'd love to get my hands on a beta copy of Perfect Dark & GoldenEye. I know they exist somewhere out there... Maybe one day. A few years ago it'd have been the XBLA remaster of GoldenEye but we finally got that!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm especially excited about Star Fox 64 recompiled. That game must be a dream to play with native widescreen and high framerates. F-Zero X is another title that I think would be interesting to see on PC.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>You‚Äôre ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what‚Äôs your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Wouldn't really know, I'm quite simple when it comes to pizza toppings! Anything meaty is fine by me though, kebab pizza is probably one of my favourites if I had to choose.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What‚Äôs your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive item I own in my collection (other than my PC lol) is probably the official Golden Gun prop replica, while not exactly a gaming item - it is definitely appreciated by those who played GoldenEye!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Finally: How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'd have to count... x1 RGB modded N64, x1 UltraHDMI modded N64, x1 Pikachu Edition N64, x2 Black N64, x1 Jungle Green N64, x1 Ice Blue N64, x2 Xbox 360, x1 Xbox 360 Elite
				x1 Xbox 360 Slim Devkit, x1 Xbox 360 Slim RGH modded, x1 Xbox One, x1 Xbox One X, x1 Xbox Series X, x1 Switch, x1 Wii, x1 Wii U, x3 (?) DS, x4 DS Lite, x1 3DS OoT Edition, 
				x1 New 3DS XL, x1 New 3DS XL Metroid Edition, x4 Gameboy Advance SP, x2 Gameboy Advance, x1 Gameboy Pocket, x1 Gameboy Color and x1 Steam Deck... I may be missing something. (37)</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Thank you very much for your time and being part of my ReCollect64 Q&As!</p></div>

				<p>If you too are a James Bond 007 fan and want to see some seriously skillfull GoldenEye 007 playthroughs, I would highly recommend giving Graslu00 a follow on twitter! You can do so here:

			<h2><span class="badge hot">HOT</span> <span class="title">SummerCart64</span></h2>  
			<h5 class="subtitle">The Freshest Flashcart ~ Jun 04, 2024</h5>

				<h4>Whats New With You?</h4><hr>
				<p>As part of my ongoing N64 collection I have recently purchased the SummerCart64, a brand new flashcart from Phenom Mod that not only plays your N64 ROMs and homebrew, but also plays 64DD ROMs without the need for conversion!</p>
				<p>Krikkz EverDrive 64 X7 has been my go to for a while now, since I upgraded just after it was released in 2019, and before that I happily used the EverDrive 64 2.5 without issue. SummerCart64 stands on the shoulders of giants and takes multiple strides forward, building on everything thats great about the EverDrive series of carts and adds in features such as native 64DD emulation and heaps of developer forward features.</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Reviews/SummerCart64/SummerCart64.png"><img src="Blog/Reviews/SummerCart64/SummerCart64.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Reviews/SummerCart64/SC64 Front.png"><img src="Blog/Reviews/SummerCart64/SC64 Front.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

				</span>
				<p>Some people try to argue that clones are better value, and easier to get hold of. I have never bothered with knock-off devices because though they get the job done, they always seem to have some form of hiccup when it comes to durabilty and software support. I know plenty of people that have purchased a cheaper clone only to have it fail or quite literally fall to pieces just months down the line. This ¬£120 pre-built model is extremely convenient, though for much less the unit is entirely self-buildable, 3d printable, and flashable!
				<p>The build quality of the SummerCart64 feels really nice, it uses a sleek plastic finish on its smokey grey exterior that feels wonderful even though it doesn't have the tactile texturing of the OEM carts. The cut outs for the Micro SD card and the USB-C connector are recessed nicely (note: the SD card slot is miniscule and difficult to remove once in) and the hex bolt screw are a nice solid touch to hold it all together.
				<p>The first thing I noticed about the cart is that there is a somewhat gangly button on the rear that clunks around a bit, it really needed to be spring-loaded, or more less rattly, to push it up even higher in the build-quality stakes IMHO. This button can be configured to change 64DD disks, sending USB packets or raising N64 interrupts for devs.
				<h4>SummerCart64 Features:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>100% N64 ROM compatibility (z64/n64/v64)
					<li>64DD hardware emulation: loads 64DD disks (+ ROM combo/multi Disk)
					<li>UltraCIC_C: region switching (enhanced)<li>Up to 2TB Micro SD card supported
					<li>Comprehensive ROM save database (including HomeBrew headers)
					<li>Comprehensive ROM information display<li>Real Time Clock support (CR2032 battery)
					<li>Emulator support (NES, SNES, GB, GBC) ROMs
					<li>Saves: EEPROM 4/16 kbit, SRAM 256/3x256 kbit, FlashRAM/SRAM 1 Mbit
					<li>Auto writeback after ~1s to the Micro SD/USB
					<li>N64 ROM box image support<li>Music playback (MP3)<li>Background image (PNG) support
				</ul>

				<h4>Sleek Hardware with Great Software</h4><hr>
				<p>After formatting your Micro SD card to EXFAT or FAT32, you will need to <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/tag/rolling-release" target="_blank">download the latest sc64menu.n64</a> and copy it to the root to load the OS on your virgin SD card. Using a PC and card reader to drag and drop whatever you want onto the device and make any folders you wish is very simple, though you can also use the sc64deployer app on PC. The only stipulation is that the 64DD IPL files need to be stored in a folder called "menu".
				<p>Selecting N64 and 64DD ROMs is straight forward, select with A and then load with A, however, playing games like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit requires you to do the following:
				Select the N64 cartridge ROM (F-Zero X [J].n64), back out with B (dont load the game with A), select the F-Zero Exp Kit dump (NUD-EFZJ-JPN.ndd), then hit R to load the pair in tandem. While this works fine and only REALLY applies to F-Zero X and Dezaemon 3D, I still feel that there should be a simpler way to do this, it feels a little clunky in its execution.
				<p>At first, for the life of me I could not get the thing to connect to my PC, so I couldnt set the RTC or update the firmware. I later found out through <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood" target="_blank">@LuigiBlood</a> that there were specific <a href="https://ftdichip.com/drivers/" target="_blank">Windows Drivers</a> required to communicate to the device, and this allowed me to flash the update and sync the RTC to my PC with ease. 
				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest" target="_blank">sc64deployer</a> app is for loading ROMs, updating, backing up and debug terminal access. It's a command-line app and as such relies on a sequence of commands to operate, luckily the <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/blob/main/docs/00_quick_startup_guide.md" target="_blank">SummerCart64 Documentation</a> covers everything you could possibly need to know. All I needed were to the commands: "sc64deployer.exe firmware update sc64-firmware-v2.18.1.bin" and "sc64deployer.exe set rtc" to get me where I wanted to be with the device.

				</span>
				<p>The load speed of ROMs is extremely fast from the SD card, and from my testing: EVERY ROM I threw at it worked perfectly without having to convert a single thing. Backing up saves for sharing or modifying also worked brilliantly well and was exceptionally fast!
				<p>As you can see the SummerCart64 is packed full of features and also includes ROM information with boxart support as well as emulation within the OS. The emulators include Neon64 V2 for NES, Sodium64 for SNES, GB64 for GameBoy & GameBoy Color, and TotalSMS for Sega Master System/Game Gear and SG1000 (not currently working)! The emulators work to a point, the SNES emulator is a little less refined and there were some layer issues in games like </i>Super Mario All-Stars + World</i> but they played well enough to be enjoyable!</p>
				<p>The SummerCart64 is an incredible device, with blisteringly fast load times, compatibility across all regions & ROMs, plus the ability to play games like F-Zero 64 with the Expansion Kit without the need for the 64DD itself! Whats more the SummerCart64 project is completely open source meaning you will see community improvements, forks and more making it truly future proof.

			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Easy to load up & play<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> 64DD emulation is a gamechanger<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Compatibility is nigh on 100%</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Rattly button on the rear<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Tiny, fiddly Micro SD slot<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Needs a GUI for PC connectivity</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>SummerCart64 is a superb addition to any N64 set up thanks to its open-source nature and sub ¬£100 price tag if you build it yourself. The plethora of options and modes available make this a superb developer tool and an astonishingly good flashcart.
			<p>With community created menu themes and styles already popping up, such as a vibrant boxart-heavy <a href="https://github.com/ArthCarvalho/n64menu" tagert="_blank">Nintendo Switch Online theme</a>, it certainly gives the EverDrive 64 X7 some stiff competition!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Quest64, or should I call you Brian/Mike?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Mike is fine, over the last few months we've become pretty friendly and it's nice to use a name üôÇ</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Shall we kick-off this Q&A by describing your Questing antics on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't think I really have a thing anymore to be honest. The overall goal is to make Quest 64 more visible on the internet in a memorable way, but the road to getting there is weird. 
				There are days where I focus on jarring people's memories about the Nintendo 64 and the games outside of the normal Goldeneye/Smash Bros/etc...posts you see all the time. 
				Other days it's talking about the retro gaming discourse and what we can do to improve it for everyone. A lot of times it's just Quest 64 memes and me chasing people around social media with pictures of Brian. 
				I like to keep it fresh.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The first system our family owned was an NES, my parents got it for my brother and I when I was 4/5 (early 89). It was an absolute blast and my Mom was super into it as well, 
				so a lot of my gaming memories and favorite games were ones I shared with her. She is the reason I have such a fondness for Bomberman, as Mega Bomberman on the Sega Genesis was a longtime favorite of hers.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have a lot of physical games, though I have been trying to shave my collection down as I get older. There was a point where I probably had between 4000/5000 physical games across all the systems.....
				but as time has passed I've sold/traded some of them to continue building my Nintendo 64 collection (and make more space in my house)</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Absolutely! It's the Nintendo 64! Another system my parents bought for me, and one we shared a bunch of memories with....something I'm trying to keep doing with my kids.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't have a routine for games, though obviously I play Quest 64 quite a bit lol. Most of my game time these days is games my kids want to play, so it's been a lot of ARMS, Animal Crossing, Roblox, Kirby Forgotten Land...and almost always on the Switch. 
				I still play a fair amount of Nintendo 64, but mostly games I didn't grow up with so I can familiarize myself with the entire library more.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My favorite go to snacks are all banana based. I like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, banana pancakes/bread and smoothies....but for traditional garbage food I'm fond of regular Lay's potato chips and Dr. Pepper. Really anything will do though, I'm a food hole.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't really thing there's one thing I hold above everything else. I have a fondness for Densha De Go pocket watches, so that's probably the most unique thing in my collection.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>This one is a moving target for me. There's not one thing I dream about, but when I find out that there's an article I want to read in a hard to find copy of Gamefan magazine or a official N64 soundtrack I've never seen before and isn't online.....
				I tend to get hyper-fixated.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>YES! The amazing people over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP" target="_blank">Quest 64 Speedrun Discord</a> were already working on a traditional decomp of the game, but the new Wiseguy tools are exciting and I hope to see Quest 64 make it's way to PC through a recomp sooner than later!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>You‚Äôre ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what‚Äôs your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm traditionally a cheese pizza guy, but if forced to pick three more toppings I would probably do onions, sausage and red chili flakes.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What‚Äôs your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive game I every purchased was Super Bowling...I think I paid $250USD for it, but that money came from selling a bunch of Guitar Hero guitars during the pandemic to make space in my basement, so it was close to a wash. 
				The most thrifty thing came recently, I spent $1 at a thrift store on a Code Lyoko OST CD that regularly sells for north of $100. Hopefully I'll be trading that soon though as there are lots of people looking for it and that's not really my thing.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have around 45 consoles but as for games, I have no idea anymore lol. I do have just over 500 N64 games, and the total games across all systems is probably north of 3500-4000. I really should go through and re-catalogue everything but that seems like such a job....especially when I really don't play a lot of them anymore.</p></div>

			<h4>Who Doesn't Love a Bargain?</h4><hr>
			<p>When I saw the QuickShot NitroStick (yes that's what they called it!) for sale recently, at a ridiculously low price of just ¬£5, I jumped at the opportunity to add to my selection of oddball N64 accessories.
			<p> QuickShot made a few accessories in their time and this was perhaps their most specialised piece of input equipment for the N64, specifically having been made for the controlling of aircraft. 
			I dont know if you know this but there are only a handful of "flight-sim" games on the Nintendo 64 including <i>Buck Bumble, Lylat Wars (Star Fox), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, AeroFighters Assault</i> and <i>Pilotwings</i>, so there isn't much to pick from!
			<p>The NitroStick has the Z-Trigger on the rear as you would imagine, the A and B buttons are up on the top of the stick along with a hat-switch that acts as the D-Pad. On your left-hand side are the C-buttons, the L/R triggers in button form and the start/turbo/reset buttons too. 
			Lastly, on the underside resides a switch that converts the input from analogue to digital, so if a game requires D-pad input instead of stick input, you're sorted!
			<h4>It's Good, But Not Perfect</h4><hr>
			<p>QuickShot sadly didn't build this thing with games like <i>Lylat Wars</i> in mind, because the pew-pew button is not in the correct pace as you would hope, the Z-Trigger, its on the A button. You cant re-map the buttons either so it feels a little off, but on the other hand games like AeroFighters and even <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> utilise the Z-Trigger for your main guns and it feels superb!
			<p>Handling in-game feels nice, really nice, and the pitch and yaw of this stick really builds the immersion when playing games that best suit this equipment. In actual fact ANY game could theoretically be played with this controller, including <i>Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye,</i> or even <i>Zelda</i> if you REALLY wanted to, but I wouldn't. 
			Barring a couple of these fringe-case flight sims the NitroStick doesn't feel great for RPG/FPS/Platforming play, as the learning curve becomes huge, so stick to the perfectly formed trident-controller for those games!
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Feels great for flight games.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Exceptional precision.</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> No remappable buttons.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Limited use for games.</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>It's not for everyone, nor is it for every game, but I kind of like Quickshot's quirky stab at a realistic flight stick.

			<h2><span class="badge new">NEW</span> <span class="title">The iQue Player</span></h2>  
			<h5 class="subtitle">A plug-and-play N64 ~ May 29, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" alt="iQue" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">iQue Player</div></div>
				<h4>Interesting Retro Tech</h4><hr>
				<p>Not only will this site offer information on your favourite console, I also aim to fill your mind-hole with info on a plethora of accessories and interesting related devices too.</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Accessories/iQue A1.png"><img src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Features/iQue/iQue Box Front.png"><img src="Blog/Features/iQue/iQue Box Front.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

				</span>
				<p>In Y2K China's government imposed a ban on games consoles, so Nintendo had to think outside the box to crack the market. The iQue player is an oddity in that it is a console
				that is built into a controller, and it only plays N64 games that have been paid for and downloaded to the memory card. This system was to combat rampant piracy in China, 
				and it worked up until as recently as 2019, when it was hacked by Normmatt, Marshallh, Stuckpixel, Riley/ROL and SUXXORS.</p>
				<p>The iQue had just 14 games available in its life time, these were:
				<ul>
					<li>Animal Crossing<li>Custom Robo<li>Dr. Mario 64<li>Excitebike 64<li>F-Zero X
					<li>Mario Kart 64<li>Paper Mario<li>Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth<li>Star Fox 64
					<li>Super Mario 64<li>Super Smash Bros.<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<li>Wave Race 64<li>Yoshi's Island
				</ul>
				<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask</i> was meant to be release too, which even featured as a screenshot on the iQues box, but it never happened. Additionally a Traditional Chinese Translated 
				version of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was found ready for release in Taiwan (ROC) but it never happened.</p>
				<h4>A Beautiful Design</h4><hr>
				<p>When I bought mine in 2021 I was elated to have finally got my hands on one of my unicorns (I have a list I'll explain in another post). 
				The console was notably different feeling to an N64 controller, due to the missing middle prong and the more traditional form factor. It was smoother, sleeker heavier, and kind of nice! 
				I booted it up thinking that not a lot would happen, and luckily I had the paired memory card supplied with it. I was buzzing to find not only <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario</i>, but also <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>OOT</i>!.
				<p>The games are all localised in Chinese and so look incredibly different when they boot up, and I find that fascinating to observe!</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				</span>
				<p>The iQue could be the ultimate way to play N64 games, for its simplicity and form factor. Nintendo sound definitely revisit this system-on-a-chip model if they ever make an N64 "classic" because it is ideal 
				for pick up and play and the analogue stick feels really nice too! The only caveat is lack of multiplayer without an additional device, but these days Nintendo could implement online instead, HDMI out, and possibly let you use your 
				Bluetooth N64 controllers for the Nintendo switch on it for local multiplayer.
				<p>The 64-bit possibilities are endless!

				<h4>When it comes to N64 gaming, what's your ReCollection?</h4><hr>
				<p>I got my console day-one, from Toys R Us, after patiently/impatiently waiting on the "if someone doesn't come collect theirs, you're next in line" list. 
				Without thinking, I bagged a console, <i>Super Mario 64</i> and a green controller, though why I bought a second pad when SM64 clearly wasn't two player is an enduring mystery.
				<p>I excitedly phoned my friend that evening and telling him to come round ASAP to checkout the 3D graphics. The idea of doing homework was thrown to the wayside that night!
				<p>I have great memories of borrowing <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> off another friend, swapping out <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> for a bit. Turok was one of my first experiences of FPS games, and I loved every blood-soaked second of it!. 
				<p>I was at secondary school when N64 released, so my friend-group had weekly meet-ups at each others houses, to share and play whichever games we had purchased. We regularly held 4-8 player tournaments for <i>ISS, Killer Instinct Gold, Lylat Wars, Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye</i> to name but a few. 
				If it was during our lunch breaks: we were guaranteed to be late back to class.
				<p>Almost 30 years on and I still play these games regularly, and I am now closing in on my attempt to collect a full world set of 388 titles. I have just 12 to go!</p>

				<h4>Why ReCollect64 exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>I found it a minefield to get an app that could let me check off my personal collection, tracking exact versions such as UKV as opposed to EUR or AUS instead of EUU. I have tried to collate as much information as possible into one resource, along with matching images for box art, cart lables, manuals and accessories. 
				<p>N64 collection apps usually reside as phone apps that don't contain regional variants, every ROM revisions or even correct images to accompany all of them. 
				ReCollect64 aims to change this by bringing images, information and a full featured and customisable collection app to any device that has a web browser. 
				<p>N64 will always be my favourite console, and I'm proud to present the next itteration of my passion project, which is now known as ReCollect64! 
				<p>Whether you are reminiscing (Recollecting) the nostalgia of the console, or embarking on collecting a specific set (Re-Collecting): you can use the site to do this and much more! 
				<h4>Why this Blog exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>The ReCollect64 Blog will regularly provide a distinct format with articles centering on the world of N64! 
				<p>Firstly there will be weekly Q&A chats with prominent faces of the N64 world, giving an easy to read and light hearted insight into who they are and what they're about!
				I have had a lot of support and plenty of willing victims messaging me join the fun, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I already have more than 10 Q&A chats lined up!				
				<p>Secondly I will be reviewing games, accessories and merch relating to the Nintendo 64, both new and old whereever possible. If you have an suggestions or would like me to review something N64 related, my coms are always open (see below).
				<p>Lastly, there will be featured posts that contain news, ReCollect64 site updates, interesting modern developments or simply reminiscing the old days.
				<p>Overall this is simply a space for sharing neat things, memories and bathing in nostalgia, nothing too heavy. 
				<p>So please bookmark this site, spread the word, and check in from time to time to relax and unwind!
