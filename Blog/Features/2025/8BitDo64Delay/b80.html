	<h4>Emailed Estimate</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>On February 28th, I received an email from Amazon regarding my preorder for the 8BitDo 64 controller to go along with the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b37" target="_blank">Analogue 3D console I preordered back in October</a>. Originally, Amazon estimated the controller would release on March 19th (possibly leaking he consoles release date?) however, this email states that the controller is now estimated to be shipping on the 28th of April.</p>
	<p>Can we extract from this the information that the console might also not be meeting its "Q1 2025" release date, or is it simply a supply issue with 8BitDo?</p>
	<p>The 3D console will be playable with existing N64 pads as well as virtually any Bluetooth controller. I'm hoping that I can use my BlueRetro receiver and my NSO wirelessN64 controller on the console while I await my 8BitDo 64 to come through, should the console still release prior to the controller.</p>

	<p>The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller revives the iconic N64 layout, but wrapped in an ergonomic, updated body. A precision hall-effect joystick with the original gate and signature concave rubber joystick cap. Say goodbye to the infamous loose joysticks. We’re bringing back the signature C-buttons, A/B and Start—with the button sizes, positioning and feel just like the original.</p>
	<p>Multiplayer on the N64 defined an era, and now with Analogue 3D and the 8BitDo 64 Controllers, that era is redefined. The 8BitDo 64 Controller, designed hand-in-hand with Analogue, creates an experience like no other when paired with Analogue 3D. It’s a celebration of the N64, the greatest multiplayer system ever.</p>
	<p>It’s Bluetooth-ready, with vibration support and platform compatibility with the new Analogue 3D, Switch, (including N64 Online) and more. Play N64 games like never before with the best of both worlds in your hands.</p>

	<p>No official emails have been sent from Analogue themselves, so we can only hope that there haven't been any delays on the 64-bit hardware. The lack of any solid release date or public demonstrations of the 4K device in action leaves a small nugget of doubt in my mind. I could be completely off base, but it's a legitimate possibility.</p>

	<h4>Mystery Machine</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Analogue has yet to demonstrate the hardware's capabilities, nor have they put up any video or images for people to mull over. The fact that no tangible marketing has gone up yet is slightly concerning, with people such as myself having backed this product without actually being able to witness what it's capable of.</p>
	<p>The only working images we have are of the "3DOS", which will power the system. We can infer from these images that the FPGA-based system will log playtime, store screenshots, display per-game information (scraped), save state slots, cartridge-based loading and also an internal library feature. How well the games look or play on the 4K device has not been publicly demonstrated yet.</p>
	<p>Notably, one of the screenshots above shows <i>Mario Kart 64</i>'s Jumbotron over the tunnel in Luigi Raceway working perfectly fine. This is a brilliantly reassuring demonstration of the system's avoidance of emulation in favour of operating on a transistor level, essentially cloning the original machine and outputting at 10x the resolution. The developer note that the Analogue 3D will not support openFPGA.</p>
	<p>There is also a sneaky screenshot of <i>Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge</i>, a game that never made it to release on the console (<a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b53" target="_blank">as mentioned in my prototypes article back in early December</a>), which proves that the system is capable of playing ROMs from storage as well as cartridge games.</p>

	<p>With Q1 2025 pertaining to January to March, I would hope that, being the 1st of February today, Analogue will post something sooner rather than later to keep the momentum and reassure early adopters that the machine will be extremely capable and flawless.</p> 
	<p>The biggest reason people have faith in this console is because Analogue has historically delivered on their products, such as the Pocket, Duo, Super Nt, and Mega Sg. They have also reportedly put four years of research and development into the Analogue 3D.</p>
	<p>Fingers crossed that this is just a demand issue, with a first-come, first-served mentality towards those who ordered theirs first still being able to receive theirs in time to use on the system when it launches. Whatever the date may be.</p>
