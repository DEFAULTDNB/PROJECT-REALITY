	<h4>"The N64 Had No Games"</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have heard this a lot throughout the years. People would sound off that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games" target="_blank">SNES had 1,700+ releases</a> and that there were a startling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_(A%E2%80%93L)" target="_blank">4000+ games on Sony's first PlayStation console</a>, but the N64 had "f#&k all." I would typically retort with "What percentage of those SNES/PSX games have you actually played?" and the answer was always very few, perhaps a handful of games, but definitely no where near a significant percentage of the available titles.
	<p>Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Super Nintendo had a lot going for them, particularly RPG games, movie tie-ins, and light guns! During the 90's, they were fierce rivals, with the whole reason the first PlayStation existed being for Sony to spite Nintendo after the sourness of their illfated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_NES_CD-ROM" target="_blank">SNES-CD</a> partnership.
	<p>Rivalry is a good thing in the industry because it nurtures progression, innovation, and most importantly, variety. But back then, obtaining 1000+ games was impossible for most people, and within each console's respective catalogue was undoubtedly a percentage of dud titles. The bigger the catalogue, the higher number of games that small percentage represents.
	<p>With the N64, Nintendo utilised their "seal of quality" to best effect, ensuring endless torrents of sub-quality games didn't show up on their platform and thus the number of games quickly dimished. That, plus Ninetndo 64's cartridge-based approached to distribution as opposed to CD, meant smaller or more optimised games and higher development and manufacture costs. 
	<p>If you wanted your game on a Nintendo, it had to be good! There were even games like Resident Evil 2 that is today deemed the impossible port, because of the incredible amount of optimisation and skill it took to whittle down 2 CD's worth of data (757 MB to be precise) into a tiny 64 MB cart.
	<h4>Disecting the N64 Catalogue</h4><hr>
	<p>As a collector, I like to know how many games it takes to complete my collections, so I recently broke this down and discovered that of the N64's 388 individual titles, within that you have (roughly) 83 Sports titles, 65 Racing, 49 Action, 36 Fighting, 25 Platform, 20 Simulation, 18 Shoot 'em up, 16 Adventure, 16 First-Person Shooter, 14 Puzzle, 14 Board Games, 
	9 Strategy, 8 Party, 3 Card-based, 1 Rhythm, and a couple more miscellaneous ones that slip through an indescript net. I have classed these fairly loosely because there are arguments for and against calling the <i>Zelda</i> games RPGs or action-adventure games, and while both are true, which is really the most accurate categorisation? You could probably cantankerously argue that you're role-playing as Wayne Gretzky, Superman, or even Star Fox in their titular games.
	<p>You could even get more granular and sub-categorise sports games, for example, into ice hockey, soccer, fishing (OOT also had fishing in it), and so on, but for the purposes of keeping it simple and easier to follow, I have kept the genre split to a minimum with games falling into their most approximate categories.
	<p>I wanted to visualise this data and see what proportion of the N64's catalogue made up those categories, so I crafted a crude chart. As you can see below, the N64 was actually a sports-heavy console with racing and action-based games at the forefront, regardless of it being synonymous with some of the best FPS games ever made:
	</p>
	<center><div id="myChart" style="width:95%; max-width:500px; height:500px;overflow: hidden;"></div></center>
	<script>
	google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
	google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
	function drawChart() {
	const data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
	  ['Genre', 'Number'],
	  ['Sports',83],
	  ['Racing',65],
	  ['Action',49],
	  ['Fighting',36],
	  ['Platform',25],
	  ['Simulation',20],
	  ['Shoot em up',18],
	  ['FPS',16],
	  ['Adventure',16],
	  ['Puzzle',14],
	  ['Board game',14],
	  ['Strategy',9],
	  ['Party',8],
	  ['Misc',5]
	]);
	const options = {
	  title:'Genre Breakdown',
	  is3D: true,
	  responsive: true,
	  maintainAspectRatio: true,
	};
	const chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('myChart'));
	chart.draw(data, options);
	}
	</script>
	<h4>Vital Statistics:</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While the N64 had less than 400 games to its name, of those titles, which ones stood out? Well, though most "top 10s" almost always site adventure and platforming games for the majority, there is notably only one sports title in the feature: <i>Mario Tennis</i>.
	<p>This seems to indicate that though the N64 was saturated with over one fifth of its titles being sports games, they were rarely impactful or console sellers. The N64 has had a reputation for having mainly first-person shooters on it, but the reality is that under 5% of its catalogue is actually comprised of FPS titles, and of those 16 games, 2 of them hold the second and third spots in the N64's all-time top ten on Metacritic, a site that aggregates thousands of reviews per-game.

	</ol>
	<p>I think that the majority of the N64's preconceptions spring from the fact it had 4-player support, and as such, experiencing multiplayer FPS games in front of one single TV screen was unheard of in the late 90s. A lot of people have shared memoires of playing the likes of <i>Turok 2, Rage Wars</i>, and even <i>Duke Nukem 64</i> in the luxury of their homes with three mates huddled around a screen. Those days were massively impactful formative memories of a relatively fledgling gaming environment where more than two players competing together was brand new.
	<p>RARE notably stepped up and excelled with the N64 hardware, exclusively bringing us not one but two solid first-person shooter titles that every other console manufacturer at the time would be jealous of, for years to come.
	<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> and its spiritual ancestor, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, are two of the most incredible FPS games ever made, transcending the N64's end of life in 2002 and still being talked about in 2024!</p>

	<h4>False Negatives:</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the games listed above still being referenced today, the N64 is perhaps a misunderstood console. It could also stand as one that people possibly missed out on during the late '90s, and as a result they either had a PS1 or held on to their SNES until they eventually graduated to the PS2, DC, and GameCube era.
	<p><i>Ocarina of Time</i> is widely acclaimed as the best game ever made. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was a pivotal release in demonstrating and redefining the analog stick and showing off innovative 3D platforming. <i>GoldenEye 007</i> redefined and pioneered the modern FPS, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> raised the bar 007 set, and is still revered as a masterpiece. I'm not saying that the PS1 didn't have highly rated games; I'm just pointing out the ratio of quality vs quantity that Nintendo's "seal of quality" stood for back then.
	<p>In <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" target="_blank">Metacritic's</a> top-rated games of all time, <i>OOT, GE 007</i>, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> solidly hold three of the top 20 spots, while the nearest PS1 entry sits at number 23 with <i>Tekken 3</i>. Personally, I love the Tekken series of games, so I fully appreciate <i>Tekken 3</i>'s longevity in the charts.
	<p>It's great to see that the N64, a console that purportedly "had no games", still holds its own in 2024.
	<p>Personally, I can recommend a whole slew of games for the system, the majority of which were N64 exclusive up until very recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/NightdiveStudio" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios</a> have done a stellar job in bringing N64 gems, such as the <i>Turok trilogy, Shadow Man</i>, and <i>Doom 64</i>, to the modern consoles. I recently completed all of those on my PS5, and I have to say it was the perfect blend of enhanced graphics, rejuvinated controls, and pure nostalgia; highly recommended!
	<p><i>Diddy Kong Racing, Rocket Robot on Wheels, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Space Station Silicon Valley, Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness</i>, and <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> to begin with are all worthy of your attention, even today.
	<p>(Note: DK64 & Ogre Battle haven't been available since Wii U VC.)</p>

	<p>None of the above games are available on recent platforms, probably due to licensing restrictions, but regardless, they are N64 exclusives that are still definitely worth a look today.
	<p><a href="blog.html#b3">N64Recomp</a> should pave the way to enjoy these games on PC again, with better framerates and upscaled resolutions. Their style, playability, and originality are through the roof, so I cannot wait to get stuck back in!
	<p>Hopefully this will set the topic to rest, and allow people to enjoy the games they want to, however they want. Emulation, ports and OG hardware are all fine by me!
