	<h4>Progressively Worse</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r30" target="_blank">yesterday's review of <i>64 Oozumou (64 ≈åzum≈ç)</i></a>, <i>64 Oozumou 2 (64 ≈åzum≈ç 2)</i>, or "Sumo 64 2" is the sequel that takes what made the first game semi-playable, and somehow makes it a little worse.</p>
	<p>Released in 1999, the second game in the series pours a layer of baby oil (literally, the models are shiny) over the original models, giving them a fresh lease of life. The background detail is slightly improved too, with bigger arenas and more spectators crammed into the periphery.</p>
	<p>Character animation is just as stylised (read: poor) as the first game, with basic, jerky, keyframe animation in the cutscenes that doesn't look great for a game released in 1999. Beyond the announcer sounding particularly pronounced over the fighting action, nothing much has progressed here graphically, audibly, or animation-wise since the 1997's outing. By comparison, in 1999 we also had <i>Donkey Kong 64, Jet Force Gemini</i>, and <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> blowing our minds with fluid animation and crisp graphics. 64 Oozumou 2 looks extremely dated when put anywhere near those incredibly polished titles.</p>	
	<p>The reinvigorated career mode with 47 characters and 9 arenas, sees you take on more battles to increase your stats and standing. However, each fight either seems to be over in seconds or lasts forever. Each one is punctuated by longer, more dreary sequences of dialogue, bringing any action to a grinding halt far worse than the first game did.</p>

	<h4>Diddly Squat-thrust</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game features a robust creation suite that allows you to create your own fighter by editing the body type, hair, eyes, mouth, technique, and colour of your pants. There are 16 skin tones, 16 hair colours, 36 eye colours, and 38 colours for your undies. You can also change up your moveset with 77 techniques and 50 finishing moves. Once you have your fighter, you can save them to the memory pak for selection later on, even against a friend in multiplayer.</p>
	<p>Again, and it's no fault of the game itself, but there is no translation patch available, so playing it is extremely clunky for anyone who cannot read Japanese, to get through the mountains of dialogue that make this game slightly less bearable than the first.</p>
	<p>64 Oozumou 2 is not the improved sequel I thought it might be. In fact, it manages to come off worse than the original by feeling lazy in its construction and laboured and monotonous in its execution.</p>
	<p>If you want action-packed fighting, then this is not the game for you. However, if you want to sumo wrestle on this console then this is about as good as it gets, and it's not that great.</p>

	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Far too much dialogue in between bouts.</br>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The same gripes apply to this one as they did with the original, but somehow the action is slower, and nothing truly feels more advanced or more polished than it's prequel.</p>
	<p>Where it loses a couple of point for lack of technical progression and increased boredom, it regains a point for adding a create a fighter, and while it doesn't add too much to the game, it's a nice addition nonetheless.</p>
