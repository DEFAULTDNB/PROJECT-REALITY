	<h4>Raising the Bar</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Over the past couple of weeks I have been reconfiguring this site to be a bit more userfriendly and a lot more accessible. With less loading in mind, I wanted to alter the layout to highlight the articles and allow readers to chose which items they wanted to read. I have also opted to remove the old site map, and deploy a simple navigation bar at the top which will hold a heck of a lot more going forward, and will provide links to articles much quicker.</p>
	<p>Here are a few notable changes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Split page method to show persistent nav bar (top) and shortened post link feed (bottom).
			<li>Nav bar, stuck to the top of the viewport, for ease of access.
			<li>Nav bar links populate the bottom of the page without the need to open a new tab or window.
			<li>Tidied up main blog page, shorter "headline" feel, and the option to read more.
			<li>Articles always return to top of the home page.
			<li>Existing shared links should work still, however, this is still being tested.
			<li>New sections coming soon!
			<li>Proper mobile support will come eventually.
		</ul>		
	<h4>Blog Roll</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>So the main feed format is gone due to several factors, mainly formatting issues. The length of the initial feed was causing a lot of positional displacement when the slew of images and embedded links eventually loaded.</p>
	<p>The upshot of this effort, is that the ReCollect64 blog should be far more more accessible. However, I'm sure I've missed something or there are teething issues to iron out once it is made live, so please bear with me as I try to get everything up to speed.
