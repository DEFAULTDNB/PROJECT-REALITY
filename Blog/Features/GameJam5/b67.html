	<h4>Jammy Jammers</h4>

	<p>Back in October,<a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b39" target="_blank"> N64brew declared that they were holding their 5th annual Game Jam, and that the theme was "Competitive Minigames"</a>. Well, over the course of the last two months, twenty-one games have been submitted, and today an update has been posted along with the ROM!</p>
	<p>The singular ROM that has been made available online contains all of those entries, has a title screen, options to increase or decrease game difficulty, an option to blacklist games you don't want to play, and allows you to set it up for up to four players to compete in. The ROM is compatible with all flashcarts (or emulators that support the Libdragon SDK), has built-in CPU AI, rumble pak support, and none of the mini-games require the expansion pak to run.</p>
	<p>Critically, emulators such as Mupen64 and Project 64 will not support this ROM because of the SDK in use, so the recommended emulator is Ares, which can be found here: <a href="https://ares-emu.net/" target="_blank">https://ares-emu.net/</a></p>

	<h4>Super Submissions</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Here is a brief rundown of the 21 games included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>64Beats (JvPeek)</b> - A rhythm game akin to <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i>. It's like <i>Beat Saber</i> but for boomers. Hit the directions with the C-Buttons on the beat to score more than your opponents!
		<li><b>Coin Rush (HailToDodongo)</b> - A stunning side-scroller featuring 2d characters in a 3D world, slugging it out to collect the most coins! There is a boss fight as well as various mechanics that cause you to fall off and lose coins. Whoever has the most coins at the end wins!
		<li><b>Destroy! (Ultrarare)</b> - An isometric <i>War of the Monsters</i>-type smash 'em up! Stomp around as a giant mutated lizard, destroying buildings with B, but avoid tanks and other players!
		<li><b>FurBall (Radish64)</b> - Climb up and down a ladder shooting randomly appearing targets. Frantic and addictively fun for the competitive!
		<li><b>Halcyon Hexagons (Strawberry Byte: .zoncabe, s4ys, mewde)</b> - Jump across perilous platforms to turn them to your colour, the player with the most platforms, or the last one standing, wins!
		<li><b>Holes (Strawberry Byte: s4ys)</b> - A Holes.io clone where you must try to devour as much as possible. You get progressively parger with each object swallowed, allowing you to then eat larger objects.

		<li><b>Le Tohu-Bohu (tfmoe)</b> - Find the Key and be the first to open the safe. Tricky to out run your competition once you have the key.
		<li><b>Lucker's Arena (Tanner P - Ritter7124)</b> - This game is a homage to a mini game of a custom game in Warcraft 3 Frozen Thrones. Spin to win. The game plays like a fruit machine.

		<li><b>Sword Strike (Super Boognish)</b> - A free for all battle, but take one hit and you're out! Last Player standing wins! Great use of the Wilhelm scream here.
		<li><b>The Third Arm (Riistahillo)</b> - Twister for your fingers. Hold or smash the highlighted buttons, do not press other buttons. A tricky game, but addictive.

	<p>I spent the morning playing through each game and voting for them via the Google Forms link below. I have to say that the quality of these games is superb across the board, but some stand out far higher in terms of skill and artistry.</p>
	<p>My personal favourite is easily <i>Coin Rush</i> by HailToDodongo, because it looks fantastic with four colourful 2D <i>Paper Mario</i>-like sprite characters combined with a 3D world, interactive objects, special effects, and multitudes of on-screen pentagonal coins, all running with very little noticeable slowdown. It is so playable and so incredibly well made that I would love to see this developed further into a full game, with more stages and more boss battles!</p>
	<p>I also really liked <i>SpaceWaves</i> because it demonstrates very simplistic 3D gameplay mixed with wonderfully vibrant graphics and overlays to achieve something spectacular. Notably, <i>Sneks</i> has a very unique cell-shaded look to it and a <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>-style hovercraft feel to its movement mechanics, which I also really enjoyed!</p>
	<p>Please take time to check it out for yourself, give it a fair vote, and donate if you can. The winners of this contest will get to donate the $1747 prize pot to their chosen charity when the voting comes to a close. I will provide further updates when that happens.</p>
