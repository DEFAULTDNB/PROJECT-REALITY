	<h4>Geared for Success</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Guillemot is not a name you hear very often in 2024! In fact, you wouldn't, because the company now owns brands like Thrustmaster and Hercules, so everything they put out nowadays is shrouded in alternate identities.</p>
	<p>Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, the Nintendo 64 was going full pelt, and with over 50 racing games in its arsenal by the end, it was only a matter of time before more companies made a bee-line for the console with their third-party wheels. As a matter of fact, Nintendo never officially made a wheel for the N64; they only licensed permissions for other companies to create wheels for their system, similar to how they do today in partnership with Hori on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
	<p>With similar peripherals available for both the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64, aptly named the 32/64, the Guillemot Access Line Race Leader 64 is probably the lengthiest name for a peripheral yet. Originally costing £80, this wheel certainly looks the part with its flappy paddle gears, but how does it perform?</p>
	<p>Costing me just £15 on eBay, the wheel arrived promptly, but with completely the wrong pedals. The included pedals were for a Microsoft wheel and were entirely incompatible with the Race Leader 64, so I thought any chance of a review for this had flown out the window. Luckily, a few days later another parcel arrived, and it was the correct pedals!</p>
	<p>The Race Leader 64 features a height and pitch-adjustable steering column, a rumble/memory slot compatible with most games, high-sensitivity mode select, and all the buttons you might need in a racing game including two yellow triggers on the rear of the wheel as well as the paddles. There is no notable analogue stick, as they typically aren't required for racing games, but more on THAT shortly!</p>

	<h4>Pedal Power</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the correct pedals connected and feeling nicely planted on the ground, there was a new problem; the pedals operated the analogue stick up and down rather than the gas and brake (A/B) buttons I would need to drive a vehicle. The game I had chosen to play, which I replay almost every year around the most festive of times, is </i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, because it's just so damn playable!</p>
	<p>Reading online and scouring eBay for any information, I found out that in order to change the pedal mapping, I needed to consult paragraph four in the instruction manual. I didn't have the manual, and I couldn't find one online, so I resorted to messaging every seller on eBay who had one in a box, and after a couple of days I had a result! I was told that to get the pedals working in <i>DKR</i>, <i>Mario Kario 64</i> (1&2, I guess that means the players choice version as well), <i>Multi Race Championship, Extreme G, Top Gear Rally, San Francisco Rush, Automobili Lambourghini 64</i>, and <i>F1 Pole Position 64</i>, you have to press a pedal whilst holding the select button, then press the button you want to map to it. This was great; however, the settings are not stored onboard, so this sequence is needed every time you start up your console to replay the same game over and over.</p>
	<p>Gripping the wheel, the Race Leader 64 feels superb. The shape of the wheel is slightly oval, rather than perfectly circular, and you feel like you're in a racing car as opposed to any old street car. The buttons on the front are easy to reach, and the little D-pad is particularly handy when in menus.</p>
	<p>The wheel has no rumble built in, but there is a handy socket to plug your rumble paks into under the chin of the wheel. It also has an eject button there for easy removal, which is great because most of these third-party peripherals are extremely unforgiving when it comes to plugging and unplugging your paks.</p>
	<p>There is no analogue stick built in on the wheel. Most wheels simply emulate the X axes of the N64's analogue stick, which this one does too; however, in games such as <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, you need an analogue stick for the flying sections. The Y axis on the stick is used for altitude, so it becomes impossible to complete those sections with this wheel unless I unmapped the buttons again. <i>DKR</i> is the only example I can think of where a racing title needs this functionality, so with that in mind, we can actually play every other N64 racing title with ease, and with mapped gear shifting for more technical games, on the paddles too!</p>
	<p>Games like <i>Extreme G, Top Gear Rally 2</i>, and <i>World Driver Championship</i> worked superbly, especially with manual transmission selected; it was a pretty thrilling experience, though I am plainly terrible at any geared game. The point is, the Race Leader is comfortable to use and brilliantly devised for 99% of racing games!</p>
