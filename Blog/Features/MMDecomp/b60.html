	<h4>Time Crunch</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Majora's Mask decompilation project began life in March of 2021. Some three years later, the USA V1.0 ROM has now been 100% decompiled, meaning that the output is a perfect 1:1 match of the original ROM's source, including all boot, code, assets, and overlays.</p>
	<p>With the decompilation complete, the resulting mm-n64-us.z64 ROM has an MD5 hash of f46493eaa0628827dbd6ad3ecd8d65d6 for those who like to verify their files, but what does this <i>REALLY</i> entail for end users?</p>
	<p>As with <i>Super Mario 64</i>, it becomes possible to port the game code to other platforms such as Windows, Linux, Android, PlayStation 2/3/4, GameCube, DS, 3DS, Dreamcast, Xbox, Wii, Wii U, Switch, PSP, and Vita, though homebrew-enabled console will be required to enjoy it when it happens. Simply decompiling the game does not make a port instantaneous or guaranteed.</p>
	<p>The main things that tend to pop up first are mods for the N64 ROM, which can be quickly distributed as patches. The exposed code opens up easy ways to change in-game textures, models, and mechanics. Some examples of this are inserting new characters and multiplayer or cooperative mods. Porting the code base to other consoles requires complex environments, dependencies, and pipelines set up and tuned for each game to get the program recompiled into executable form for those specific platforms, and this usually takes a lot of time, even before enhancements come like 60 FPS, modern controls, or widescreen support.</p>

	<h4>Boss Mode</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>According to the project lead over on their Discord server, the merging of code already decompiled from the final boss, Majora, has now pushed the project to become a 100% matching code decompilation for the US version of the game.</p>
	<p>Just like the Ocarina of Time and other decomp projects, the work doesn't end there, as other regional ROMs and variants will want to be decompiled too, but bear in mind that this does not include the 3DS games, just the N64 1.0 versions and 1.1 revisions from USA, EUR, and JPN regions.</p>
	<p>It's interesting that 2Ship2Harkinian  essentially utilised a "dirty" version of this decompilation effort, using a branch that was decompiled fully but not mapped out with correct variable names. This shortcut meant that they could use the existing decomp long before it could be technically labelled as 100% completed.</p>
	<p>The recent <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b3" target="_blank">Majoras Mask Recomp project by Mr-Wiseguy and Dario Samo</a> also took a different approach, in statically recompiling N64 binaries into C code on the spot. Though that project has been worked on in the background according to Git activity logs, no public updates or new Recomp games have been released yet.</p>
