	<h4>MAXIMUM POWER</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Did you know that <i>Wave Race 64</i> went through several changes before becoming the well-rounded, chill-vibed, aquatic racing title it's known as today?</p>
	<p>To begin at the beginning of the game's ancestry, <i>Wave Race</i> for the Nintendo GameBoy was released in 1992, and was a top-down jet ski racing game that played a lot like most racing games of that era. So why was the sequel initially set to feature 3D futuristic boat racing instead of jet skis again?</p>
	<p>Under the working title of "Wave Racer", Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development really did intend for the game to be "F-Zero on water", developing an engine that could handle dazzlingly high speeds and multiple vehicles on screen at any one time. However, this was not to last too long, as when it was displayed at Space World in 1995, people weren't overly enthralled by the concept.</p>
	<p>In 1996, Nintendo announced at E3 that they were redeveloping the game again, now under the guise of "WaveRace" with a brand new "jet-ski" engine and new vehicles to make it a truer successor to the GameBoy classic. This is possibly due to potential licensing deals with Kawasaki, along with the encouragement of Rare's <a href="https://x.com/intimsworld" target="_blank">Tim Stamper</a>, who has been historically credited with heroically steering Nintendo's vision back towards realistic jet ski racing, instead of sci-fi powerboats.</p>
	<p>Personally, I think Nintendo initially devised faster boats rather than personal cruisers in an attempt to shake up the series. The first game garnered middling reviews, and as an 8-bit game, it obviously couldn't create much of a splash, so switching it up with a more popular racing franchise of the time, <i>F-Zero</i>, might inject the fledgling series with more energy and also allow the team to showcase more technologically impressive effects on the brand-spanking-new Nintendo 64 console.</p>
	<p>Nintendo would go on to use the initial "WaveRace" game engine and "power boat" vehicle designs for <i>F-Zero X</i> in 1998. The failure of the 64DD shifted F-Zero's development to cartridge, and when it eventually released, we got to see the speedy 60 FPS smoothness of the engine, even with 30 racers on screen at once, with no aquatic effects or morphing to be seen, just a laser focus on pure unadulterated speed.</p>

	<p>Having examined footage from Shoshinkai/Space World 1995 (above, just past the four-minute mark), you can definitely observe the evolution of the DNA that came from the alpha "Wave Racer" and would form into <i>F-Zero X</i>, through the similar machines and the tube-like sections of track, though "Wave Racer" was to be set in various locations around the globe with realistic physics, as opposed to the futuristic locales of <i>F-Zero X</i>'s gravity-defying vehicles.</p>
	<p>The transforming nature of the watercraft is an extremely interesting one, namely because this idea was never used in either game series going forward. The mechanic of transforming probably revolved around spreading out for power, or barging, and becoming more aerodynamic for speed and overtaking. Nintendo tends to have heavyweight and lightweight classes in the majority of their games, so the transformation button may have been an attempt to avoid strict weight categories and level the playing field a little, leaving it to the player to utilise the transmogrification as they thought fit to gain an advantage over their opponents.</p>
	<h4>Move on to the Next Round!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the next evolution of the Wave Race 64 we would recognise today, came the HUD and characters. I haven't seen this mentioned a lot elsewhere, other than on <a href="https://x.com/WaveRace64" target="_blank">WaveRace64's Twitter account</a>, but there were a fair few changes that the game went through even after the entire direction was changed and it was now an established jet ski game.</p>
	<p>Sadly, there isn't a lot of footage to go on here, just fourteen hot-wet seconds, but there is still quite a lot to unpack as you watch through it.</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmK6xnw0FcM"></iframe></center>
	<p>The first thing I noticed was the distinct lack of the "Kawasaki Jet Ski" branding. At this stage in 1996, they must not have had any firm partnership/licensing going on with Kawasaki, and so it is entirely absent.</p>
	<p>Secondly, we notice the wave physics. We finally have a player riding a machine with inverse kinematics at play to further convey buoyancy through the rider's stance while gliding across them. The water looks translucent and extremely similar to the final product, which actually uses transparent grey wave layers over a coloured sea floor texture to achieve the effect.</p>
	<p>The next thing I noticed was the number of players; there appear to be five in a race as opposed to the four we are accustomed to, and all of those players are skinned as the wet-suited front man, Ryota Hayami (brother of Akari Hayami of <i>1080Â° Snowboarding fame</i>), in his P1 colours. I can only assume that the full cast of characters hadn't been devised yet and that the game was being stress tested for the number of players feasible in a race. Five remains a strange number given that a typical jet ski race can have 8-10 racers, the N64 had only four controller slots, and the final game only featured two-player splitscreen to retain its framerate.</p>
	<p>Another obvious change is with the HUD elements style and placement. The power meter is completely different, opting for an analogue gauge at first and not becoming the iconic series of "MAXIMUM POWER" chevrons it sprouted in the final build of the game. The buoy/miss counter is also far smaller and more tucked away compared to the final game. Perhaps Nintendo was toying with a more simulation, rather than arcade, feel to the game and trialled a more minimal HUD to express that.</p>
	<p>The last point of note is the apparent format of the races. Now, I realise the footage is excruciatingly low quality, just 360p, and undoubtedly recorded from VHS, yet the environmental staples appear to be quite different from the retail format. The level demonstrated, which you should probably assume is a test level, or precursor to Dolphin Park or Sunny Beach, doesn't have any notable points of interest or obstacles to navigate. It only appears to have the signature finish line as well as the red and yellow markers to ride through and an encircling row of buoys to signify the "out of bounds" edge of the explorable area.</p>
	<p>Perhaps the performance trade-off of taking the racer count down by one meant more background geometry was able to be used in the final version of the game. Chances are that this is just a test level for generating waves and monitoring track paths, but simply racing between buoys around an empty ocean would not have provided enough visual stimulus for a fully fleshed-out final game.</p>
	<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> gifts us a plethora of vivid and iconic locations such as Glacier Coast, Marine Fortress, Sunset Bay, and Twilight City, each with dramatically differing lighting, wave patterns, and weather conditions to behold. I wonder if Nintendo originally experimented with dynamic courses that were generated entirely at random, or perhaps if they planned on real time weather or a day-to-night cycle, because quite a few first-party games on the same system did eventually utilise those concepts, after the release of <i>Wave Race 64</i> in 1996.</p>
	<p>1998's <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> employed a day-to-night cycle to accentuate the dangers inherent in adventuring in the dark, and also in <i>F-Zero X</i> (1998), and later in <i>Excitebike 64</i> (2000); both went on to use a randomly generated track feature, which critics noted gave each game remarkable longevity and replayability.</p>
	<h4>You got Boost Power!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The hypothetical takeaway from all of this, if you haven't realised already, is that had <i>Wave Race 64</i> stuck to its original engine, it may well have been the game that had randomly seeded track generation, and even an expansion pak track editor, for up to four players to enjoy! Conversely, we would likely never have had jet skis, dolphins, and stunts to pull off, and we also probably wouldn't have ever seen <i>F-Zero X</i> or <i>F-Zero GX</i> come to exist in that alternate timeline either.</p>
	<p>The connections between those two titles don't end there either. <i>Wave Race 64</i>'s only female character, Ayumi Stewart, is theorised to be a relation of <i>F-Zero</i>'s Golden Fox pilot, Dr. Robert Stewart. Both also share eerily similar acceleration/top speed traits, as well as the surname! Given that <i>F-Zero X</i> is set during the 23rd century, and Ayumi was 21 years old in 1996, it's a pretty distant ancestry!</p>
	<p>Sadly, no work-in-progress beta ROMs have ever leaked publicly for <i>Wave Race 64</i>, so very little evidence exists of it's development cycle other than the sparse, low-quality, videos and various snippets of information from the magazines of the era. One day I hope that something juicy does eventually leak out (like <i>Dinosaur Planet</i> did), and we all get to experience the original "F-Zero on water" on our flashcarts.</p>
	<p>Until then, I will continue to enjoy <i>Wave Race 64</i> for the fascinatingly gorgeous game that it is, even if Nintendo refuses to give us a remaster or new entry into the series past <i>Blue Storm</i> on the GameCube. And no, <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>'s Power Cruising mini game does not truly count!</p>
