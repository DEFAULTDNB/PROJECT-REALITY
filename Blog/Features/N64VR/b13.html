	<h4>Project (Virtual) Reality</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As many of you know, I love VR. I had a PSVR at the very beginning, upgraded to the PSVR2 and Quest 2, and then more recently, I've progressed into AR (augmented reality) and MR (mixed reality) by upgrading to the Quest 3. When I learned of VR mixing with my favourite topic, N64, I simply had to look into it!</p>

	<p>James Lambert, former Portal 64 dev, took up a new challenge in March 2024, and that was to create an outlandishly sounding; N64 VR hardware mod.</p>
	<p>By utilising an Oculus Rift DK1 Developer Kit and building a custom USB module for I/O, James has managed to cobble together a method to use a VR headset on the 64-bit beauty, albeit at a very rudimentary level. The 2013 DK1 hardware has a basic resolution of just 640 x 800, and the sensor output over USB lends itself well to integrating into the N64 console, thanks to James' innovative thinking and N64 coding prowess.</p>

	<h4>High Tech, Low Res</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>At just 320 x 420 per eye resolution, the N64's Expansion Pak enhanced Hi-Res 640 x 480 output capabilities don't exactly make it an HD powerhouse, especially when it comes to being hardy enough to support VR output. Lowering the resolution to 320 x 240 affords higher frame rates, but excruciatingly grainy graphics in comparison.</p>
	<p>Pyroxene put together a small demonstration environment to showcase and test the headsets tracking and gyro abilities, but as James comments, there is noticeable input lag, and it very quickly becomes nausea inducing.</p>
	<p>Following the N64 VR project video, James added a second video in June showcasing his VR compatible Super Mario 64 ROM hack!</p>
	<center><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwbxGGJC3M4"></iframe></center>
	<p>With some amazing optimisations and some clever know-how, James has tapped into a retail game to bring it a new perspective. It's not perfect, but it works, and as such, it proves that virtually anything is possible!</p>
	<p>I don't see this becoming quickly accessible to the public even with a mass-produced USB adaptor, nor do I expect anyone to want to endure motion sickness for such a niche project, so I wonder if this POC will go any further, to operate with FPS games or even homebrew such as James' own Portal 64 demake.</p>
	<p>Regardless, it is truly incredible to view such projects and ROM hacks, and in case you were wondering, I will be covering Portal 64 soon because it is such an incredible project too!</p>
