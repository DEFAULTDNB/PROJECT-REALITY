	<p>2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the release of <i>Worms Armageddon</i>, the explosive game of turn-based tactical warfare featuring Lumbricus Terrestris, also known as the humble earthworm.</p>
	<p>The game, which landed on the Nintendo 64 on December 11th, 1999, featured four-player gaming without the need to pass the pad thanks to the N64's quadruple controller sockets and brought the most frantic, ludicrous combat imaginable to players huddling around their CRT TVs.</p>
	<p>Team17 and Digital Eclipse took the opportunity to bring the squidgy invertebrate strategy game to new players digitally on their latest-generation hardware, with releases on PC via Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 26th, 2024.</p>

	<p>When Worms Armageddon released in 1999, it scored an average of 82% across a multitude of reviews. The game was widely praised for weapon selection, replayability, sound effects, and graphic style, though it was mainly critiqued for not having all the features of its sibling PC release. Notably, the the Petrol Bomb, Napalm Strike, and Longbow were left out of the N64 version.</p>
	<p>The game was re-released recently on Limited Run Games in 2023, with a neat fleshy pink cartridge, though the release was marred by lengthy production times of up to two years for the collector's edition, generally poor reception to the cost-to-value ratio, and the bashed-up condition of the boxes when shipped. The official site also lists <i>Worms Armageddon</i> as two-player, which is odd as it is in fact four-player!</p>
	<p>This Anniversary Edition: Collectors Edition hasn't suffered the same treatment; instead it was announced in September of 2024 alongside the digital release.</p> 
	<p>With an additional six-player online mode, <i>Worms Armageddon</i> now has even more strings to its bow in 2024, so will you be picking this up? Have you been playing it digitally already? What are your thoughts on this game?</p>
