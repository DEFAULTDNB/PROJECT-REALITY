	<h4>Visualising Variables</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If the N64 had an operating system, something that booted before a game cartridge was even inserted and controlled various things about the console, such as audio and video formats, sound and colour tweaking, real-time clock adjustment, or even internet connectivity, what might it have looked like?</p>
	<p>When Nintendo conceptualised the Ultra 64 around 1993, they had workstations built by Silicon Graphics to develop their games on. These graphics workstations, dubbed "Indy", used an operating system known as IRIX, which was based on UNIX. They used IrisGL (similar to OpenGL) and ran on MIPS processors that were massiveley more powerful than the average PC at that time, making them ideal for developers, 3D modellers, and animators.</p>
	<p>IRIX was a basic yet visual operating system, competing with Windows and Macintosh, and as such, Nintendo likely deployed Silicon Graphics 3D File System Navigator for IRIX, as seen in <i>Jurassic Park</i> when Lex exclaims, "It's a unix system, I know this!". She was close; it was, in fact, IRIX!</p>
	<p>The principle with the SG3D Filesystem, is that files are displayed as three dimensional-cuboids, and the amount of data within them is indicated by the physical size (height or depth) of that object. Colour schemes and icons are used to distinguish images from documents and databases from executables, for example. It's basic, but futuristic and visually interesting.</p>

	<h4>The DNA of Design</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The current N64 NSO selection demonstrates how Nintendo handles the N64 box art and settings on their latest console, but sadly this is no indication as to how it would have looked on an N64 nearly 30 years ago. Trends change, visual standards improve, and the way we use and access things has evolved far beyond any preconceptions we had in the '90s. As such we must think that the N64 OS would either be more akin to early operating systems or visually similar to their N64 games select screens.</p>
	<p>I believe the latter would be the weapon of choice, as PC operating systems were too data-driven and visually bland. Nintendo likes to produce colourful, vibrant content that is iconically branded and differentiates Nintendo from other platforms. In 1993, Windows NT 3.1 was the latest OS for PCs deploying Microsoft's patented window panes to display layers of complex information at a time. For a console, this type of interface would simply not work; it needs to be extremely stripped back and doesn't need to convey tonnes of information at a time, just important options with visual cues, meaning less to get lost within.</p>
	<p>Prime examples of menus within Nintendo 64 games express extremely simplistic, yet visually interesting, clutter-less user interfaces, with a mouse-like input on the analogue stick and a button press to confirm or go back. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was the game that came out on the console's release date, so it stands to reason that a day-one operating system on the N64 would be similar to that of the menus seen in <i>Super Mario 64</i> to maintain parity and to reduce confusion with its initial users.</p>
	<p>You can ceratinly identify where Nintendo creativley borrowed from the IRIX file explorer aesthetic for <i>Super Mario 64</i>. It was new and exciting, and definitely something never seen before on a console. Simple flat squares that click and flip, and a primitive colour scheme to relate each file and each option. Even in the menu's Nintendo was flexing the console's 64-bit muscles with woodgrain and stone textures, along with 3D animations, effects, and sounds. They then evolved these ideas further for <i>Paper Mario</i>'s menu screen, instead of opting for more game-specific texture theming, further removing the generic look of computer-based UIs and primitive shapes.</p>
	<p>Nintendo notably also virtually ditched the mouse-dragging input style altogether for menus, instead using a method of snapping to selectable elements; it is more intuitive and quicker, especially without a mouse in hand. With the <i>Zelda</i> titles, it was slightly different; they clearly paid homage to the NES and SNES games with the name input and file select, but then added in more streamlined, toggle-orientated settings screens that wouldn't draw anything away from the gameplay.</p>

	<h4>Software Simplicity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I think that <i>Majora's Mask</i>'s initial "options" screen illustrates precisely what I think an N64 operating system might have evolved into during the console's lifetime, offering a glimpse of a simple yet classy aesthetic once you delved into its settings. Don't forget that <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>Majoras Mask</i>'s in-game menu screens were styled to be within a cube that could be rotated, and though I'm not convinced that would have been a good starting point for an N64 OS, I definitely think that these were all DNA strands for the GameCube's retail firmware and BIOS menus. The GameCube's extra horsepower meant that styling and flair went above and beyond into its BIOS/IPL-loaded operating system, dubbed "Dolphin OS" after the Flipper chip, which was codenamed "Gekko" during development.</p>
	<p>If the Nintendo 64 OS recognised game cartridges that were inserted, then each one would have had to contain an icon, or the console would have to download one to make the game look cool when the user went to start it. This would have been easier to manage with internet connectivity, as the carts themselves didn't have much storage space to spare in most cases and definitely not enough for several legible pieces of artwork, like box shots or manuals, per game. The console could definitely have recognised the region (via boot code CIC), NUS ID to show the name of the game, save type and location (cart or memory pak), and the size and version of the ROM on the cart.</p> 
	<p>Internet connectivity would have also opened up the way to online leaderboards, downloadable patches, DLC, manuals, and possibly even save file upload and download for backing up and sharing, albeit painfully slowly by todays standards. It all sounds a lot like what the 64DD and Randnet had planned, but with todays modern ideals being reimagined for a more primitive time. A time when the internet was dial-up and storage was a new concept, expensive, and measured in mere megabytes.</p>
	<p>It's interesting to imagine a world where these things could have been possible and more interesting to think that modern FPGA and emulation could allow us to have a proprietary OS on future iterations of the console.</p>
	<p>The classic consoles Nintendo released for the NES and SNES demonstrated a very basic slideshow-like OS, which contained all the data, images, and relevant information for each game, such as the number of players. Sadly, the N64 Classic never materialised, but I imagine the UI would have been based on the NES and SNES classic and possibly even the iQue's, though that's a whole different can of worms.</p>
	<p>Either way, these types of OS could clearly be extremely useful on the N64 if it had its own HDD available to store this information. It would effectively be an emulator-like UI with the ROM being read from the cartridge, similar to how the <i>Project 64</i> emulator can read ROMs directly from a USB-connected cart reader. An emulator-like front end could also be used to display expansion/memory/rumble requirements, memory pak management, remapping buttons, and testing the analogue stick. Essentially, the OS could easily have contained the same functionality as the N64 Test cartridge controller diagnostics, Rumble Pak test, RSP, RDP, video, and audio tests too. All of which could have been updatable online as and when new titles or improved test features were developed.</p>

	<h4>The Ultra OS</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Based on the latest OS Nintendo has used on the Nintendo Switch, dubbed "Horizon OS" or HOS for short, we know that Nintendo prefers to opt for simplicity and ease of use. HOS is the natural evolution of the previous 3DS OS, which was also built in C++ but contains elements of FreeBSD and Android, though it is not a derivitive of either. Everything is easily accessible, and everything is very familiar visually speaking, ultilising modern standards and icons to signal where to click to get whatever setting you're after.</p>
	<p>With the console known as Ultra 64 in '93, and prior to that "Project Reality", it stands to reason that the OS, or technically the firmware, could either have been named "Ultra OS" or "Reality OS" at first, though it also could have needed to change to "64OS" or "OS64" to avoid issues with naming, as they did with the console thanks to Konami owning the name "Ultra Games".</p>
	<p>Sadly, we will never see any prototype ideas for the N64 operating system because putting a cartridge into the console effectively completed the circuit before the power is turned on. There is nothing for the N64 to boot, no games built in like the Sega Master System, and no BIOS or IPL to show anything or even do anything for the hardware.</p>
	<p>So with that said, what do you think an operating system would have looked like? Have I missed any critical points, or have I raised decent ideas worthy of a discussion? Please take a moment to like, share, and comment on your thoughts on Twitter or Bluesky today!</p>
