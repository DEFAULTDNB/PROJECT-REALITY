	Banjo and Kazooie have landed back at Youtooz in search of the last Jiggy to unlock Gruntilda’s Lair! Well, after a quick nap of course! Sculpted to perfection by our Youtooz Jinjo’s to capture their essence flawlessly, Banjo sits curled up with his paws resting on raised knees and a huge smile stretching across his sleepy face, while flopped out atop his head lays a slumbering Kazooie with their wings and tail slumped. This night light sits at 6.3 inches tall and is perfect to sit perched on your bedside table, desk, or anywhere that needs a little extra light! So just slap in 2 x AAA batteries, flip the switch and you’re ready to watch them illuminate with a spectacular warm glow that will light up even the darkest of nights!

	<h4>Plushie Perfection</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Each toy is made from minky, tricot, and felt materials, stuffed with 100% PP cotton, and features official licensing from Rare, which means you're getting the best quality available and with a likeness you can trust.</p>
	<p>The Conker plushie has particularly stolen the show with his trademark helmet, cigar, and dual wielding uzis! The Banjo-Kazooie ones feature intricate detailing too, with Banjo's backpack and necklace, and Kazooie looking super cutesy and ready to adventure.</p>
	<p>With the SKUs labelled as "All Out Battle" "Tuckered Out" and "Besties", it leaves the door open to future iterations of the lovable characters in new poses and costumes. Conker has a massive wardrobe, so he could be dressed as anything, like Neo from the Matrix or maybe even riding a T-Rex!</p>
	<p>YouTooz last endeavoured into N64 territory with <a href="https://youtooz.com/collections/conkers-bad-fur-day" target="_blank">4.8" <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i> statues, mugs, and pins</a>, as well as a slew of <a href="https://youtooz.com/collections/banjo-kazooie" target="_blank"><i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> figurines and merch</a> in 2022, and they even went as far as to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Youtooz/comments/s038o2/youtooz_super_mario_64_concept/" target="_blank">tease us with a <i>Super Mario 64</i> BLJ (backwards Long Jump) meme concept</a> back in 2021, though the odds of that ever getting OK'd by Nintendo were slim to none.</p>
