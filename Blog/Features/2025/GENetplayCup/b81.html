	<p>As an update to <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b73" target="_blank">the previous post</a>, TH126 has today shared updated information about the GoldenEye LTK Netplay Cup V line-up. Some big names are competing this year, so it's going to be an event you will definitely not want to miss!</p>
	<center>
	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One hour from now (9 PM ET), groups for the GoldenEye Netplay LTK Cup V multiplayer tournament will be selected! Meet the players and watch the group selection live: <a href="https://t.co/aHhE4bC50A">https://t.co/aHhE4bC50A</a></p>&mdash; TH126 (@THOneTwoSix) <a href="https://twitter.com/THOneTwoSix/status/1886579720529035394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	<p>The event will be split into six main groups (plus a group of byes), and the matches will be held online for everyone to spectate over at TH126's Twitch channel, which is linked at the bottom of this page.</p>
	<p>Each group will be playing a three-player match, using pistols in License to Kill (LTK) mode, with the winner being the first to obtain 20 kills. The map the players will duke it out on will be randomly selected prior to the game.</p> 
	<p>Twenty-two players have been selected for play and filtered into the following groups:</p>

	<h4>Group Stage Gang</h4>

	<p>With the competition starting on Friday, the 7th of February, the LTK Cup V results will be posted on TH126's social media accounts as well as being tallied here on ReCollect64 each weekend going forward.</p>
	<p>The previous year's winners have returned en masse to reclaim glory. David Skedar Warrior came 3rd in LTK Cup IV (2024), and AXDOOMER came third in LTK Cup III (2023). Competition host TH126 came second in LTK Cup I (2010) and first in LTK Cup II (2011), and Robbie won LTK Cup I (2010) and placed second in LTK Cup II (2011) and IV (2024). The biggest contender, and the one to beat, is Graslu00, having won LTK Cup III (2023) and LTK Cup IV (2024), returning to defend his honour and try to claim a third consecutive win!</p>
	<p>Graslu00's 1.95 K/D ratio means that he is getting almost two kills before he is killed, making him a hugely formidable and imposing player. The margin for error in these matches will come down to pixel perfection, with previous matches demonstrating unparalleled levels of accuracy between the players and shots being made that prove that these guys are the best of the best!</p>
