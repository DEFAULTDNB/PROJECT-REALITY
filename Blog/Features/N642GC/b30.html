	<h4>Shifting Systems</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As N64 aged and the fresh-faced GameCube (then named StarCube) loomed on the horizon, developers who had promised games for the 64-bit players switched focus and opted to transfer their titles to the newer, more powerful system.</p>
	<p>Some games made the transition, others vanished into obscurity, but today I want to focus on the ones that were heading for N64 but eventually released on GameCube.
	<p>This post serves to highlight some of my favourite examples of games that switched from N64 to GameCube, rightly or wrongly, towards the end of development. Each one is accompanied by a couple of comparison screenshots and, most importantly, the current status as to whether the game is now playable in 2024!</p>
	<h4>Animal Leader / Cubivore</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Originally a 64DD title, Animal Leader was converted from disk to cartridge, before ultimately being moved to GameCube. The games complex mutation system, mating mechanics, dialogue, and battles meant Cubivore was an extremely quirky game, which many weren't convinced of, and in my honest opinion, it didn't really benefit greatly from the transition to GC.</p>
	<p>Graphically, there aren't too many changes, other than a general lick of polish and enhanced resolution. The game retains 99% of its original design, albeit with an altered intro screen and revamped bestiary.</p>
	<p>A Doubutsu Banchou N64 ROM did eventually surface in 2021, affording flashcart-based and emulation-centric players the opportunity to play the game in all its 64-bit beauty!
	<p>Below: You can see how they altered the N64 logo to become the GameCube logo in the intro animation, and image 3 is from N64, whereas image 4 is from its GameCube counterpart, but there isn't much difference to see!</p>

	<p><strong>Status:</strong> A fully playable ROM of Doubutsu Banchou is available and works fine on most retail emulators and flash carts.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Dinosaur Planet / Star Fox Adventures</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The most famous of the lost titles, that turned up in ROM form in 2021! The build from 2000 that was recovered was far from complete, but modders are still busy fixing objects, textures, and linking areas together to revive the game for flash cart and emulation enthusiasts.</p>
	<p>Dinosaur Planet was originally a completely separate IP designed by Rare around 1999-2000, but when Shigeru Miyamoto eventually saw it running, the decision was made to integrate Star Fox characters into the game and rebrand it altogether. Initially, the characters Krystal and Sabre were the main protagonists, scouring the Sauria system for spirits and preventing Drakor from destroying the universe.</p>
	<p>In Star Fox Adventures, the game deviates after Krystal's initial flight scenes and temple exploration, where it then focusses on Fox instead of Sabre, with the cast of Lylat Wars (Star Fox 64), including General Pepper, supporting Fox through his <i>adventure</i> investigating the invasion of the <i>Dinosaur Planet</i>. Instead of General Scales being the main boss character, Andross was resurrected to be the overarching antagonist.</p>
	<p>The difference in detail is astounding from N64 to GC as you can see below, the difference between Krystal's flight scene is night and day. All characters and locations vastly benefitted from the generational leap, but the N64 game still holds a great deal of unbutchered nostalgia.

	</div>
	<h4>Eternal Darkness</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Developed by Silicon Knights, Eternal Darkness began life on the N64 and evolved into a GameCube exclusive under the title: Eternal Darkness Sanities Requiem. The game was proposed to be a psychological thriller as opposed to a typical third-person survival horror jaunt and featured 12 playable characters, puzzles, exploration, and lock-on-targeted combat.</p>
	<p>When the game first showcased on the N64, it was very late into the console's lifecycle, and due to declining sales, Nintendo suggested they switch to the GameCube in the eleventh hour to bolster the launch line-up for the upcoming console release. The game scored overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release, averaging a stellar 9/10 across the board.</p>
	<p>The N64 version of Eternal Darkness was reportedly complete, with all chapters ready to roll, but as we can see from the screen shots below, the game got quite the graphical overhaul when it stepped up a generation to the cubic console. Notably, the locations are slightly rearranged and way more detailed, and the characters look far less basic.

	<h4>Resident Evil Zero</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With a playable demo at the Tokyo Games Show in 2000, Resident Evil Zero was an exciting title to be coming to the N64. The Resident Evil 2 team had previously done the impossible in 1998, bringing a 1400 MB game to a 256 MB cartridge, but alas, it was not to be for RE:Zero as the size restrictions and compression used would cause huge headaches for the developers. Ironically, focussing their efforts on the cartridges main strength, loading times, and not it's biggest weakness, storage capacity, led to the developers switching to GameCube and eventually releasing it in 2002.</p>
	<p>GameCubes 1.46 GB miniDVDs had pleanty of room for adding new mechanics and gameplay elements, and could easily handle the fast character switching and cooperative modes. The GameCube also allowed for higher resolution images, higher poly-count characters and more action on screen at once without much compromise.</p>
	<p>The slower pacing was more akin to that of the first Resident Evil game, but switching from Rebecca to Billy and having cooperative play was quite the jump, especially from Resident Evil 2's action-focused gameplay.</p>
	<p>According to sources, there is a TGS development prototype cartridge doing the rounds within private collector circles, probably where the 9-minute TGS demo footage comes from, but whether or not it was more expansive than just the train scene or will ever be dumped remains uncertain.</p>
	<p>Both characters got a major glow up in the final game, with massively more detailed models packing in far more materials and with far more realistically expressive faces. Rebecca lost her berret, while Billy gained better hair, handcuffs, and tattoos.

	<h4>Archival Arrivals</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Teams such as Carrot, SUXXORS, and IND have long been dumping and preserving N64 prototypes, betas, and variants, so much so that we now have access to a slew of games that were thought to be lost to time.</p>
	<p>I am always glad when new game dumps appears for the N64, and I hope many more lost games turn up eventually. If and when further ROMs get dumped and released, rest assured I will cover them here on ReCollect64.</p>
	<p>I also aim to cover a selection of unreleased games in a future post, so keep 'em peeled!</p>
