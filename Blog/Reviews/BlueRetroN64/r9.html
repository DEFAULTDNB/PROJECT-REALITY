	<h4>Tooth Up Your Hardware</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The N64 is approaching 30 years of age, and back in 1996/1997 BlueTooth simply wasn't a thing, it wouldn't exist for another 3 years! In 1999 the first unveiling of Bluetooth headsets for mobile phones came to pass, and with it, the possibility for hardware manufacturers to look to the future and build wireless controllers. The first generation of consoles to really take charge and lean into wireless connectivity was, of course, the Wii and PlayStation 3, which both came out in 2006, some 7 years after BlueTooth first reared its head.
	<p>Some of you may be thinking that the WaveBird by Nintendo hit the shelves in 2002 and provided wireless control for the GameCube, but it should be noted that this was via radio frequency (RF) and not Bluetooth, hence the little dials for quick-swapping channels.
	<p>It's only in recent years that the N64 has been granted the gift of wireless control, because it's so commonly available, so stable, and cheap enough to implement.
	<p>I bought my BlueRetro N64 Adaptor from the <a href="https://castlemaniagames.com/products/n64-blueretro-controller-receiver-with-memory-pak" target="_blank">CastleMania store</a> in 2023 for the princely sum of £29.99. I chose the smoke grey variant because it looked damn cool!</p>

	<h4>Plug, Pair, Play!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Taking the adaptor out of the box, you simply plug it in, turn the console on, and hit pair on both the receiver and the controller of your choosing. I opted to try out the <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-64-n64-controller-for-nintendo-switch-0000000000100069812" target="_blank">Nintendo 64 Controller for Nintendo Switch</a>, my 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless controller, and my DualSense PlayStation 5 controller. Suffice to say they all worked beautifully and quite faithfully to the experience I was expecting.
	<p><i>GoldenEye, Perfect Dark, Mario Kart 64, and Wave Race 64</i> all feel fantastic, with barely any notable input lag. This was momentous!			
	<p>The BlueRetro concept is the brainchild of Jacques Gagnon, aka Darthcloud, with the core idea being one device to flash for use on whichever console you're creating a receiver for. Conceptually sound, but end-user-flawed, the BlueRetro concept has been used for Jaguar, Neo Geo, 3DO, Saturn, and obviously N64, so it must work fine, right?!

	<h4>Update and configuration woes</h4><hr>
	<p>My first qualm came from attempting to interface with the receiver. I simply wanted to connect it, update it, and continue to enjoy my product. Alas, I found it extremely challenging to figure out exactly how to get the thing to communicate at all. Worse, I simply could not get the device to update because the "software" is so unstable it either failed to connect, or timed out mid-update, which I found incredibly stress-inducing. The fear of bricking this thing and having nothing at the end of this process was monumental.
	<p>Don't get me wrong, this device itself is fantastic, but the companion "software" leaves a lot to be desired. For starters, you need to have a browser installed that supports in-browser Bluetooth. I rock Safari and Firefox on most of my devices, and neither of those work. I had to install Chrome, enable Web Bluetooth and visit <a href="https://blueretro.io/" target="_blank">https://blueretro.io/</a>. From here I struggled. The web-based software initially wouldn't load, then when it did it repeatedly had a "GATT server" error, and when I finally managed to connect and get to the point of sending the binary to update the device, it began and promptly crashed. Several attempts later, I simply had to give up. I could not get the device to communicate with enough stability to endure the alledged 10-minute update proceedure.
	<p>Ten minutes seems obscene anyway, surely a file no larger than 580 KB should take seconds, not minutes, and certainly not long enough for the connection to time out or fail. The latest version at the time of writing was 24.04 HW1 version for N64, but the selection you can download from Itch.io contains all versions from 1.8.3 through to 1.9.3, and confusingly: version 24.04.
	<p>The net result, for me at least, is a product that is half useful. I can pair a pad and use it, but I cannot configure it. I can save and load game saves, but I cannot back them up. Ultimately, it's disappointing to not be able to use the device to its full potential, and not being able to update makes me feel like I'm missing out on any useful QOL features.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Plug-Pair-and-Play<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Has a built-in 4 bank memory pak</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Companion software is awful<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Impossible to configure or use memory pak features because of the above<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Can't use 4 at the same time (PSU power draw)</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Out of the box this thing is great, but any attempt to use its USP features was met with frustrations. Sadly, there is no dedicated app, and the web-based updater itself crashes or fails to connect either end.
	<p>It's a sad state of affairs for what would otherwise be an incredible product. Perhaps there is a better way to update this thing? If you know, please don't hesitate to contact me!
