	<h4>Not For Resale in Japan</h4><hr>
	<p>As is true today, Nintendo has a programme for giving out sample software and hardware for testing, exhibition, and displaying in kiosks. Back in the late 90s, the N64 held pride of place within store display kiosks, and the managers and owners were routinely sent fresh software to help entice buyers to bite and pick up the latest console or the newest games.
	<p>Nintendo of America famously gave out unboxed NFR cartridges to stores, most printed with a cartridge sticker that has the suffix "-DIS", aka, display, or a telltale, numbered, sticker on the back. To date, we know of the majority of N64 carts shared in the United States and even the <a target="_blank" href="Carts/ALTN/Turok 2 Seeds of Evil ALTN.png">one singular EUR/UKV NFR that is Turok 2's kiosk cartridge,</a> and we know that the instructions were to destroy them after use or send them back to Nintendo. Luckily some escaped that fate and made it into the hands of collectors, so our knowledge and information on those is reasonably well rounded.
	<p>What's less widely known is how Nintendo of Japan supplied their demonstration software. Strange as Nintendo is based in Kuyoto, Japan. As it turns out, Japanese stores were simply supplied a regular retail copy of the game. That would be a huge anti-climax to this blog post, though thankfully, that isn't the end of the story.

	<h4>Not For a Lack of Trying</h4><hr>
	<p>After some digging and consulting with <a href="https://twitter.com/JosetteTrinkets" target="_blank">@JosetteTrinkets</a>, we know that there were 26 titles that were designated "Sample Software" and distributed in the NTSC-J region, each denoted by a simple sticker on the front. These labels depicted Mario speaking the words "Please use this product as a demonstration sample". All bar one, the Super Mario 64 sample copy, which contained no ability to save, or so we thought.
	<p>Oddly, upon investigating deeper, there seem to have been titles that received green stickers too, this time with Mario riding Yoshi but barking the same phrase about being a sample. This leads me to think that when Nintendo parted with their software, they possibly still used Super Famicom sample stickers they had laying around, though sadly I cannot verify this, as I'm lacking any further examples of green Yoshi emblazoned stickers anywhere online.
	<p>To say that information on this specific subject is sparse is an understatement, so anything we can glean is valuable for preservation and informative purposes.

	<p>The quest for completionism continues, and my morbid curiosity continues to draw me ever deeper into this N64-shaped rabbit hole, having located just 18 grainy images. I will eventually obtain more information, and hopefully a full set of images to share on ReCollect64, in due time.
	</p>Does anyone out there collect these? Does anyone know the reason for the green sticker?
