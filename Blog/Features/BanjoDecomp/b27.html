	<h4>Saucy Code</h4><hr>
	<p>As of August 29th, 2024, the <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> decompilation effort has succeeded in its goal of achieving a full 1:1, 100% decompilation of the lovable Rare IP. After <i>Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Majoras Mask, Doom, Perfect Dark, and Goemon, Banjo-Kazooie</i> has reached the same ranks and now has a pool of fully legal, accessible source code for modders and hobbyists to play with. 
	<p>This paves the way for PC ports with 60FPS, widescreen, HD textures, and mods, amongst other things, and as all eyes now surely turn to Mr-Wiseguy's N64Recomp project for the first executables to allow us to play this incredible title in 2024, we must appreciate that these efforts take time, so be patient and keep checking in here on ReCollect64 for all the latest developments!

	<h4>Banjo-Newie</h4><hr>
	<p>This decompilation project, started in 2021, has been steadily reaching its goal month on month and will no doubt bring fans a lot of joy over the next few months.
	<p>The last time <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> got an outing was in 2022 as part of Nintendo Switch Online's N64 line-up, but preceding that it was back in 2015 as part of Microsoft and Rare's Rare Replay bundle. Famously, the platformer began life on the N64 in 1998 to rapturous reviews, sighting the game as a <i>Super Mario 64</i> beater and the first in a planned trilogy.
	<p><i>Banjo-Tooie</i> was released in 2001 with similar praise, but the much anticipated third chapter, <i>Banjo-Threeie</i>, never materialised due to Microsoft purchasing Rare in 2002.
