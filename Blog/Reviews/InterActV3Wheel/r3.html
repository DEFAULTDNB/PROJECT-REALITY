	<h4>Steering the Conversation</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I picked this wheel up a few years ago because I intended to craft a small, cheap as chips racing set up in my living room. I wanted to be able to re-play the <i>Top Gear Rally</i> series of games as well as <i>World Driver Championship</i> and of course <i>Mario Kart 64</i>!
	<p>The V3 feels great, even if the wheel feels a little small, though that works to its benefit by feeling tight and compact. The face buttons do a great job of 
	The wheel has two lock switches to configure the wheel in two adjustable ways. The first is the tilt of the wheel, which has two spots: 45 degrees and straight up like a forklift driver. The second lock switch controls the height of the wheel, which is a blindingly good feature to have depending on how you approach using the wheel.
	<p>You can either mount the wheel on a surface via four suction cups, or you can raise the wheel to max and plant it between your thighs like a novelty go-cart!
	The main mechanism is spring-loaded on each side of the wheels axle meaning it feels like it's pulling you back and automatically re-centres itself when you ease off.
	<p>It is possible to completely modify all aspects of this input peripheral thanks to a nifty on-board programmable button. For example, if you hold the "Set" button for two seconds you enter function mode, and from there you can either remap any buttons you like to any other button you like, or you can adjust the sensitivity of the Y-axis steering between 30/90 & 150 degrees. Setting it to 150 degrees means turning the wheel a lot, whereas setting it to just 30 degrees means quicker turning with less effort. For fine tuning, you also have a small red slider on the left of the wheel that can adjust it tighter or looser on-the-fly.
	But if you hate it all and want to reset the wheel you can do so by holding Start+L+R at any point and you're back to default in a jiffy.
	<p>The V3 comes with a set of pedals too, and these are also springloaded. They feel great, they have a nice tension and a satisfying returning action to them that feels great. They plug in to a rather weak looking DIN socket on the rear of the wheel, but both the pedals and the wheel come with 8 feet of cable to give you plenty of room to manoeuvre.</p>

	<h4>Whats the Deal?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first batch of V3 wheels was not compatible with the Rumble pak, but a second batch was produced, and by the end of 1997 everyone was treated to force feedback. Luckily mine rumbles, however if I insert any sort of third-party rumble pack the controller completely stops working, and I have to remove it before it comes back to life. I'm unsure why it does that, and it's rather ironic given the third party nature of the wheel itself, but thems the breaks!
	<p>I'm quite a fan of this wheel because it has so many features and so many comfort settings, but it gets really creaky after a short period of time because of the full plastic construction. The buttons feel great, not spongy at all, and overall it has a nice quality to it that you rarely see from third-party peripherals.
	<p>Would I have paid $79.99/£65 for this back in the day? I probably would have if I hadn't been just a child with no income of my own in the 90's. There was zero chance my parents would have sprung for this for me either, as I wasn't into realistic racing games as a kid, and if I hadn't used the wheel, it would have been money down the drain that could have been better spent on another game for the entire family to play!

	<p>Interact made some decent accessories back in the day and this is one of them. Considering I scored this for under £15 a couple of years ago, I now wish I'd had one back in 1997 to really give my racing games a boost!</p>
