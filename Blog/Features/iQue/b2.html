	<p>In Y2K China's government imposed a ban on games consoles, so Nintendo had to think outside the box to crack the market. The iQue player is an oddity in that it is a console
	that is built into a controller, and it only plays N64 games that have been paid for and downloaded to the memory card. This system was to combat rampant piracy in China, 
	and it worked up until as recently as 2019, when it was hacked by Normmatt, Marshallh, Stuckpixel, Riley/ROL and SUXXORS.</p>
	<p>The iQue had just 14 games available in its life time, these were:
	<ul>
		<li>Animal Crossing<li>Custom Robo<li>Dr. Mario 64<li>Excitebike 64<li>F-Zero X
		<li>Mario Kart 64<li>Paper Mario<li>Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth<li>Star Fox 64
		<li>Super Mario 64<li>Super Smash Bros.<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<li>Wave Race 64<li>Yoshi's Island
	</ul>
	<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask</i> was meant to be release too, which even featured as a screenshot on the iQues box, but it never happened. Additionally a Traditional Chinese Translated 
	version of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was found ready for release in Taiwan (ROC) but it never happened.</p>
	<h4>A Beautiful Design</h4>

	<p>When I bought mine in 2021 I was elated to have finally got my hands on one of my unicorns (I have a list I'll explain in another post). 
	The console was notably different feeling to an N64 controller, due to the missing middle prong and the more traditional form factor. It was smoother, sleeker heavier, and kind of nice! 
	I booted it up thinking that not a lot would happen, and luckily I had the paired memory card supplied with it. I was buzzing to find not only <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario</i>, but also <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>OOT</i>!.
	<p>The games are all localised in Chinese and so look incredibly different when they boot up, and I find that fascinating to observe!</p>

	<p>The iQue could be the ultimate way to play N64 games, for its simplicity and form factor. Nintendo sound definitely revisit this system-on-a-chip model if they ever make an N64 "classic" because it is ideal 
	for pick up and play and the analog stick feels really nice too! The only caveat is lack of multiplayer without an additional device, but these days Nintendo could implement online instead, HDMI out, and possibly let you use your 
	Bluetooth N64 controllers for the Nintendo switch on it for local multiplayer.
	<p>The 64-bit possibilities are endless!
