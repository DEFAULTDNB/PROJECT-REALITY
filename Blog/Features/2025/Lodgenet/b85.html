	<h4>Hotel History</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Did you know that between 1993 and 2013, Nintendo had an on-demand hotel service for guests to play games in hotel rooms? The Nintendo Gateway System was Nintendo's first foray into something very similar to the digital ecosystem we know and hate today. They built a pay-for-play game delivery platform that could comfortably sit alongside pay-per-view movie services, charging $7 an hour to play games that would indubitably take far longer than an hour to play.</p>
	<p>Partnering with Satellite Movie Company, they rebranded as LodgeNet in the early 90s and provided set-top boxes and controllers for use with the systems, with the Super Nintendo being the first in the line of consoles to get the LodgeNet treatment.</p>
	<p>In 1999, Nintendo added N64 to the LodgeNet system. They offered a selection of 9 first-party titles and 29 third-party games. Here is a full list of the 38 64-bit games chosen to be a part of the service:</p>

	<p>There is notable support from Midway and Acclaim within that lineup, plus a few other studios such as Titus, Crave, and LucasArts. Disappointingly, this represents less than 15% of the N64's 388-title catalogue, which is a similar story with what is offered on Nintendo's NSO service today.</p>
	<p>There were three main caveats with the available games. Firstly, you had to pay by the hour. Secondly, any game saves were wiped the second you exited the system. Lastly, any multiplayer options were greyed out. Nintendo didn't want you to have too much fun in your hotel room.</p>
	<p>There were 3 known revisions of the LodgeNet N64 box and two controller variants. Some controllers used a GameCube-style analogue stick, others the traditional thin N64 stick, but they all had a bespoke socket on the end of their cords. This meant that you could not bring your own pad to play. The fitting used was more advanced than the traditional 3-pin port. It used a custom 8-pin RJ (registered jack) connector to allow for far more buttons to be used on the controller such as Order, Menu, Select, and Reset. This controller could be used to order food on the in-room service through the TV!</p>
	<p>The LodgeNet N64 box itself contained an Expansion Pak (mainly for Majora's Mask and Donkey Kong 64), an onboard programmable CIC chip, and a trimmed-down N64 motherboard because there was no need for the controller sockets or the cartridge connector. The CIC chip was programmed to run each of the games, and as you may have noticed, all games were from the NTSC-U region, without exception.</p>

	<h4>Service with a Smile</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While I have never seen or used this service in my lifetime, some preservationists have sought to capture and share as much information and images as possible. I love this digital archaeology, unearthing interesting hardware and software, and as such, I have collated as much interesting information and imagery that I could gather.</p>
	<p>Below is footage of the LodgeNet N64 service in action. The capture was recorded on VHS, which means the quality is not HD, but it only serves to double down on the nostalgia. Take a look!</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MK_BHRfKbAk"></iframe></center>
	<p>The LodgeNet N64 ROMs were released in 2023 by an anonymous hacker who managed to chain together data from 11 IDE hard drives that had been scavenged. By using a clever system of mounting the drives, stripping, and decrypting the resulting data, 31 out of 38 games were preserved. There was also an EEPROM and SRAM eraser ROM (V1.2) dumped. It was reportedly run by the LodgeNet system before each game started in order to properly clear any residual traces of the previous game and prevent any knock-on gameplay/loading issues.</p>
	<p>All but Extreme-G, Forsaken 64, Iggy's Reckin Balls, Milo's Astro Lanes, San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing, and Turok 2 were able to be dumped, and only <i>Namco Museum 64</i> was completely untraceable, meaning it had long been removed. The majority of those were Acclaim Studios games, so I wonder if that is relevant to where the drives were initially found.</p>
	<p>The games were managed by the Gateway 64 Host Software and sent to the LodgeNet system in a *.G64 format, which is a similar byte-swapped format to *.V64. It is a strange format for Nintendo to use at all, as the console reads big-endian *.Z64 natively. Each game also contained a *.I64 information file, which effectively contained the decryption for the game and was sent to the set-top box once the player had paid.</p>
	<p>While I love the alternative-looking hardware, I'm glad Nintendo didn't use this system on their consoles. We could have had a pay-to-play system running on the N64 through our painfully slow (19 minutes per 64 MB ROM) 56k dial-up internet connections, and at those rates, it would have cost us a flipping fortune!</p>
	<p>The structuring and delivery remind me of the Chinese <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b2" target="_blank">iQue Player</a> (2003), which allowed users to play N64 games on their TVs at home. Initially gamers had to visit iQue depots to purchase new titles, but in 2004, mainly due to a disastrous launch, the iQue@Home service launched in 2004 to make it more convenient.</p>
