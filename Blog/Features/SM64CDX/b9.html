	<h4>Cooperative Kooper Crushing</h4>

	<p>After Super Mario 64 was decompiled back in 2019, modders have been beavering away at the PC build, restoring beta or lost features, adding content, and giving SM64 the quality of life updates it deserves.</p>
	<p>The original teams that were SM64EX-Coop and SM64CoopDX have recently merged together to form one uber modding team under the mantle: SM64CoopDX, to deliver the best experience possible for end users. The net result is a lot of features and no need to manually patch anything; it's all done very conveniently in the distributed executable.</p>
	<p>Helmed by AgentXLP, and formerly djoslin0 of SM64EX-Coop, Super Mario 64 Coop DX has a simple goal in mind: to bring online multiplayer with synchronisation of enemies and objects to Super Mario 64, and boy, have they done it in style!</p>

	<p>The main premise of this mod is to allow you to customise your player (no, you don't have to play as Mario), or alternatively you can be Yoshi, Toad, Waluigi, or Peach, with a number of customisations to recolour the characters the way you want them to look. I opted to recreate "The Green Thunder", Mr. L, but opted to play as Metal Mario because it just looked way cooler! Once you have your player ready, you can then invite your friends to come and smash up the Mushroom Kingdom with you.</p>
	<p>Custom characters have custom movesets, so Peach/Daisy have a floaty double jump, which is perfect for speedily getting across gaps that Mario could never have dreamed of making back in 1996.</p>
	<p>In order to play the game, all you need to do is download the latest release for your platform, run the *.exe, and drag your Super Mario 64 (U).z64 file into the window. After that, run the language config, choose your mods, and either host or join a game!</p>

	<h4>Nostalgic but New</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A variety of ROM hacks have also been ported to SM64CDX, including Star Road, Super Mario 74, and more, such as the "Hide and Seek", and "Extra Characters". You're also free to download mods and put them in your install directories aptly named "mods" folder to add to the fun! One of the coolest modifications I spotted was that of a day and night cycle. Which led to some stunning views of Peaches Castle at three different times of day!</p>

	<p>At the time of writing, V1.0 is the latest release from July 1st, 2024. This version is the culmination of previous efforts and adds updated character models for Waluigi and removes some of the preset palettes to motivate creativity.</p>
	<p>I urge anyone with a PC and a hankering for playing Super Mario 64 in 60 FPS glory cooperatively to scoop up SM64CDX ASAP, because it's incredibly fun and extremely intuitive.</p>
	<p>Quality of life features mean the game feels fresh, it looks clean and it runs like a dream even on the most outdated of PC hardware. Small in-game changes also allow for players to bump and jump off one another, making for some truly riotous moments!</p>
