	<h4>Peculiar Peripherals</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When I saw this thing on eBay, I did a double take. At first I thought it was wrongly listed and that it was in fact for PlayStation because it had "that look" about it. The grey plastic, the ever-so-90s angles and edges, and a flipping liquid crystal display!</p>
	<p>Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that it was indeed for the Nintendo 64, and it was therefore going straight in my basket. With a starting bid of just £10 and a buy it now price of £50, I was straight in at £10, and I honestly then forgot all about it.</p>
	<p>A few days later eBay was shaking me down for cash; I had won the auction for the bargain-basement price of my opening bid. I was instantly thrilled to get to try it out and couldn't wait to whip up a review for it, expressing my honest opinions on this unique-looking peripheral.</p>

	<p>The Gamester Evolution controller, I think, was legitimately thought of as the future of gaming technology by Gamester technicians. It's possibly the wildest design for any input device I've seen, ever, and I assumed its abilities would also be much overhyped. But I was wrong!</p>
	<p>Taking the LCD and trigger-endowed gun-bit in your left hand and pulling the glove on to your right hand, over your thumb and pinky as if you're dressing a hamster in a waistcoat, the Gamester Evolution controller converts you into the analogue stick; you become the device as your motions are translated into movement.</p>
	<p>The left-hand part (or right-hand part depending on your handedness) of the controller displays the settings you have selected, such as whether you're using the input as the D-Pad or the analogue stick, and it shows you just how far you're tilting, relative to each axes limits, in real time. It also houses the A, Z, and R buttons as a triple threat of triggers underneath, and on top it has the B, C-Up, C-Down, and L button, along with a small D-Pad, a start button, analogue/digital quick select buttons, axis, and scroll buttons for the LCD screen.</p>
	<p>The game I really wanted to fire up with this contraption was Aero Fighters Assault, the obvious choice to test out a device where you use your hand to simulate the pitch a yaw of a plane. If you think of your hand as now the top of the analogue stick and perform the actions your thumb would have been doing upon that plastic nub, then you can achieve anything. It is wonderous in its ability to transform your swooping and twisting into legitimately badass manoeuvres!</p>
	<p>If I was at all sceptical at first, any doubts were blown far away as I strafed the enemy and avoided incoming missiles. It was truly a fantastic feeling to know, not only that an item I had purchased as "untested" was working perfectly, but it was actually performing incredibly well to the point that it was ridiculously accurate!</p>
	<p>Rolling your fist to the left or right creates the left or right movement associated with the analogue stick. Tilting your fist toward the screen and down simulates a forward stick press, and flexing your wrist backwards (as if you're revving a motorcycle throttle) produces a downward stick press. It really is that simple.</p>

	<h4>Weak Wrists</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I also tested <i>Wave Race 64</i> and was able to quickly perform all of the riders tricks and stunts with relative ease, with the exception of doing a barrel roll off the ramp. I found it really intuitive! Platform and RPG games like <i>Super Mario 64</i>, <i>Holy Magic Century (aka Quest 64)</i>, and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> performed decently too, with the smallest of learning curves required to get the characters movements trained into your muscle memory with relatively ease. Though take note: there are no C-Left or C-Right buttons on the controller at all.</p>
	<p>Games that didn't perform well predominantly included first-person shooters. Even with ramped-up sensitivity and specifically re-tuned deadzones, I struggled to find my targets when shooting with a reticle. Shooting from the hip was extremely fun though, and it gets you a long way until you reach that padlock on <i>GoldenEye 007</i>'s Byelomorye Dam, and then you're in a bit of trouble.</p>
	<p>The biggest issue with using your entire arm as an analogue stick is that you eventually get hot-hot, searing-hot pains through your out-stretched muscles and joints after not long at all. That may be a slight exaggeration, but honestly, it's not something you'll want to play for hours without putting in the time building up a tolerance for holding your arm up at an angle for prolonged periods.</p>
	<p>It's definitely something you get used to playing with, but not something you can just pick up and expect to use without feeling it the next day. Having said that, the fact that you can pick up and play almost any game with this with very little configuration required is startling. Once I had my sensitivity set to a level I was happy with and the pitch/yaw tuned to the roll of my fist, I pretty much didn't need to re-adjust it for the majority of the titles I tested.</p>
	<p>Sadly, I didn't get any instructions with the controller, nor could I locate any archived online, so everything I managed to configure with it was through trial and error. Luckily, it was extremely easy to understand, and the little reset button on the back of the main sensor was brilliantly instinctual for quickly recalibrating to a "normal" position between games.</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The Evolution Controller by Gamester is strangely accurate and incredibly intuitive. I don't know why this wasn't more widely known about, because it is legitimately one of the most simple	yet smart devices I have ever used to play a game.</p>
	<p>With most posted for upwards of £50 unboxed, I would say that price-wise £20-£30 feels like it would be about right for this item, though getting it for a tenner is what you really want!</p>
