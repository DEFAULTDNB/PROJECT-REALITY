There is, however, a way to identify if a game features a revised ROM and that is by checking the cart's punch code. You may have noticed these before, two seemingly random numbers 'punched' into the cartridge's back label. Nintendo have never released their true meaning but it's believed they somehow reference the production factory. If the punch code is, for exampe 19 then the ROM is for the first version of the game i.e. v1.0. The numbers themselves are not important, just that they don't end in letter, and that's becuase a punch code with 19A would contain a revised ROM of the game, v1.1 or Revision A. Likewise codes ending XXB or for v1.2 or Revision B and so on.

As these changes are usually to fix glitches and bugs, it's very hard to say what the changes are unless you're very familiar with both (or all) versions. Other than what has been already mentioned the only differences I know are that Banjo-Kazooie (Rev A) fixes the "termite skip", and Diddy Kong Racing (Rev A) removes some of the lasers from Spaceport Alpha

very cool. I also would like to see the same thing done to manual and boxes. I know shadow of the empire has 5 manual revisions, MK64 & SM64 3 boxes revisions, etc. that would make a very nice list for the hardcore collector.

Its been 4 years.  Any news on the existence of:

Tonic Trouble - V1.0
F Zero X - V1.1
Madden 99 - V1.1

Or do these not actually exist?
