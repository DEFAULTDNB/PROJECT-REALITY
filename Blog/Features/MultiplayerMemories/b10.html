	<h4>Innovation from Inspiration</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When it comes to looking back over games you used to play, do you also recollect the ways you used to play them? Which modes did you favour, which controllers, and which configurations.</p>
	<p>My friends and I hammered GoldenEye. To the point that we knew every spawn point, every weapon, and every quirk each other had, but the one thing we didn't have were separate screens. Everytime we played, there was the constant fear of screen-cheating, and there was no where to hide, no let up to the barrage of action, and games were more frantic in front of a TV sat on a sofa. We played two-player games more often than four-player because the screen size was larger, the frame rate was better, and the people waiting their turn got rowdy chanting and goading us on in the background.</p>
	<p>Beyond the loadout, past the modes and the configurations, we strived for more competitive play, and over time I had various bright ideas that would revolutionise our sessions.</p>
	<p>I would take a simple piece of paper, the width of my 26" Goodman's TV, and tape it across the middle of the TV screen to give each portion of the screen some privacy. The idea was simple, a divider, and with some seating adjustments, it worked, just about. Player one sat on a chair, and player two hunched down on the floor. The two of us could play on separate screens, but I wasn't happy with this creation it was too makeshift.</p>
	<p>My Magnum Opus came as I remembered that my old 13" CRT was rotting up in the loft, and that there was a second 12" TV/VCR combo in my sister's room. There was a spark, and I immediately got to creating my ultimate gaming setup!</p>
	<p>I placed two chairs back to back in the middle of my bedroom, and using one N64, I put a splitter on the RF cable, connected two more RF cables, I then hooked up one cable to one TV and another to the second. I placed the N64 between the two chairs, on the floor, this gave equal cable length to each player, and it kept the console close to the TV's to minimise any trip hazards. I plugged it in to test my work. It was like a miniature LAN party, but in 1998!</p>
	<p>The final stage of this contraption was to place cushions in front of the TVs for each player to sit on, and then cover alternate halves of each TV with a piece of card. This meant that each player only had visual access to their half of the screen, and there would be no opportunity to cheat.</p>

	<h4>Contraption Conclusion</h4><hr>
	<p><i>GoldenEye, Perfect Dark,</i> and <i>Turok 2</i> multiplayer forced us to try out new tactics and rethink the usual way we played by having at least a little forewarning that someone was lurking around the corners. Sniping and closequater combat became edge-of-your-seat experiences because you simply couldn't nail down where someone was firing from, and you had no idea if anyone was creeping directly behind you.</p>
	<p>I remember wanting to push this one further, with a four-way splitter, four chairs back to back, four TVs, bigger TVs (!), and four pieces of "L"-shaped cardboard to caudon off other players screens. I also remember the impracticality of borrowing four chairs, power strips, and four TVs, let alone making this for comfortable use in a bedroom.</p>
	<p>Alas, a mythical four-way (play session) was not to materialise in my teenage bedroom.</p></p>
	<h4>Enter The Arena</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Though my setup was technically smart, it required a few components most people wouldn't have had lying around, so I was fortunate to have had the bits needed and patient friends who would help me test out my contraption.</p>
	<p>The Computer-Systems Arena was an almost comically priced $63 piece of hardware that deployed mirrors to reflect portions of the screen at their respective players. It's not wholly elegant, but it's effective once jostled into place, and it could work on up to 27" screens.</p>
	<p>Reviews of this peripheral were relatively positive at the time (2000), with the only unavoidable complaint being the amount of space required to set it up properly. The positivity from this new challenging way to play oozes from the majority of the other reviews, which stated that it felt weird not knowing where people are and makes the game feel akin to PC multiplayer, i.e. one screen per player.</p>
	<p>The Arena was a commercial product that would have given a similar experience to the contraption I built a few years prior. This suggests to me that I wasn't alone in wanting this type of experience from my gaming sessions, though sadly, I never so much as saw an Arena in real life, let alone heard of its existence, until very recently.</p>
