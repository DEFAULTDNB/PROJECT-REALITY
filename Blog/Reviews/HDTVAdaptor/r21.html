	<h4>Cable Management</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a connoisseur of the 64-bit console, I want to know the best way to connect my retro gear to my TV. As such, I have taken a leap of faith and bagged an HDTV adapter that comes from China, has a Japanese website, and insists it's good for the money.</p>
	<p>Picking this up for an incredible price of just four Great British Pounds, I thought this can't be that bad for the money; surely it's just acting as a connection between the console and the TV. Could I have misjudged this product? Or is this a big swing and a miss?</p>
	<p>The 720p HDTV Cable for Super Famicom, GameCube, and Nintendo 64 has the proprietary Nintendo Multi AV connector on one end and an HDMI cable connector on the other. Betwixt those is a rather ominous box that needs powering via 1.5V micro-USB. That cable is required for operation, but handily it is not supplied. The box also has a switch for 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratio switching on the fly, though pretty much any TV in the world can do this nowadays via its remote control.</p>
	<p>The company website, SRPJ.JP, leads to an incredibly basic Wix template-of-a-site that has even more layers of branding, like an onion in puff pastry. With a blue "Game Bank Web" logo plastered above the landing page and "SRProject.co, Ltd" underneath, I'm not sure where I am any more. Luckily, the copyright states "Gamebank-web.com" and that they have been around since 2014. They should know what they're doing after a decade; right?!</p>

	<h4>Chess or Checkers</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Plugging the cable into my TV, connecting a micro-USB cable, and then inserting it into the back of my gold NTSC-J console, I was immediately met with a large display, as 16:9 mode was engaged. Slapping the switch over to 4:3, I felt more at home, and the image looked more authentic.</p>
	<p>Firing up <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> I noted that the sound was perfectly as expected, but the introductory logo looked slightly off. Pressing start to get into the game, I quickly realised that the cable was producing a ghastly checkerboard effect across the entire screen. The resulting image, seen below left, was an assault on the senses, and honestly, I didn't want to see any more of it. I immediately swapped back to my current HDMI solution and took another screenshot to compare; see below right.</p>

	<p>The image quality looks like it is being modified by some method within the box, but the effect is both creating a checkerboard effect and then a weird conjoining of each square at the corners to make globs of colour. The overall image looks like it might be being sharpened or something, and it is honestly hideous. Just look at the star emblem on Diddy's jacket. It's so wrong, it looks like this copy of <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> had been bought from Temu or Ali Express.</p>  
	<p>I took a look online to diagnose the issue, other than it being a £4 solution, and honestly all roads lead to "cheapness" being the outcome, with possible shielding issues causing the bleed or flickering colours. Even the Hyperkin 3-in-1 N64 to HDMI had similar issues, with it being nailed down to interference with the composite and S-Video connections. This product is frankly a poor knock-off of the Hyperkin, which reportedly isn't great either.</p>
	<p>This 720p HDTV cable is a prime example of getting what you paid for, though you couldn't even avoid this pitfall if the retailer pumps the price up to make you believe it's better than it is. My professional advice is to use trusted brands that have been thoroughly reviewed to ensure you don't stumble onto this mess.</p>
	<p>I took one for the team so you didn't have to!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy connectivity<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>16:9/4:3 switch<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Works on all region consoles</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Terrible picture quality<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No power cable supplied</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Fundamentally, this thing fails on delivering even a comparable picture quality to using any regular method to connect your console. Heck, a standard RF cable would look better on my 65" 4K TV.</p>
	<p>Do yourself a favour and avoid this, or anything that resembles this model, at all costs.</p>
