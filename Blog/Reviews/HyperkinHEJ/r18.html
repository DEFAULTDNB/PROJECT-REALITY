	<h4>Magnetic Marvels</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When it comes to the N64, the one component that can let you down when you go to play your favourite games is undoubtedly the controller, but more specifically the joystick.</p>
	<p>Lets face it, they all get droopy with age; thats just how it is, but technology has come on leaps and bounds since the 90s, and as such, we can now restore our flacid sticks to upright glory with just a simple drop in-kit!</p>
	<p>Hyperkin's Hall Effect Joystick (HEJ) is a solder-free solution that promises to be the simplest installation around with the highest quality stick we have yet seen in the N64 replacement part world.</p>
	<p>To install the DN64R-A06 module:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Remove the nine screws holding the back shell on.
		<li>Remove the Z-trigger silicone piece and move the Z-trigger PCB out of your way.
		<li>Remove the three screws holding down the existing stick module.
		<li>Unclip the cable that connects it to the PCB.
		<p><b>Now reverse this process to get the new module in!</b></p>
		<li>Connect the new module's cable to the PCB.
		<li>Screw the three screws to hold the new module in place.
		<li>Replace the Z-trigger PCB onto the module, and push the silicone piece back on.
		<li>Put the rear shell back on and screw the nine screws back in.
	</ol>
	<p>There is a detailed instructional video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73gfI5TydVk" target="_blank">HERE</a> on Hyperkin's YouTube channel. I would advise watching it to appreciate just how simple of an installation it really is!</p>
	<p>I would say that all together it took me roughly 3-4 minutes to remove the screws, pry the PCB connector off, and have it all back together. If I can do it, then anyone can! However, I would highly recommend magnetic screwdrivers/bits because getting those last two miniscule screws in by the Memory Pak slot was an absolute nightmare for me with a basic, non-magnetic, 31-piece "precision" screwdriver set.</p> 
	<div class="info">
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</strong></p><p>The Hyperkin Hall Effect Joystick module has a PCB 6 pin connector, and as such, you cannot use this on the N64 NSO Bluetooth controller because that uses a 4 pin connector.</p>
	<p>Originally I wanted to use this mod on the Bluetooth controller, but sadly that is currently impossible without knowing what you're doing and modifying the connector.</p>
	<p>Additionally, it is worth noting that any controller that used Nintendo's OG controller joystick module could potentially be upgraded with this mod, though probably not many will have used official OG parts!</p>

	<h4>Sensor-tive Subjects</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Once installed, the first thing I wanted to do was to benchmark the sticks range and check out the gate pattern. I noticed that my OG stick, as floppy as it was, scored a respectable -79/+78 across all axes, whereas a brand new stick should register -85/+84 avg. The Hyperkin HEJ scored a reasonable -80/+80 all around, which, though better than my decrepid 27-year-old stick, still shows a very small variance of -5/+3 meaning, it is slightly undersensitive in comparison.</p>
	<p>For comparison, I found a benchmark for the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-mod-kit-for-original-n64-controller?variant=42721361920177" target="_blank">$19.99 8BitDo Hall Effect Joystick Module</a> and noted that the results were -79/+81, which is almost identical to the Hyperkin results I recorded, and averaged out, they're pretty much the same. Notably, the Hyperkin shares a very similar gate to a new OG controller, which is ideal, though I noticed that both the 8BitDo and the Hyperkin share spookily similar "pinched" top-right and bottom-right angle profiles drawn through the benchmark software. I'll have to obtain an 8BitDo one in the future for a true comparison!</p>
	<p>My daily driver is my Hori Mini Pad, so I benchmarked that with a result of -104/+99, which goes the other way in the slightly overly sensitive scale in comparison to an OEM stick, and with a far wider gate, so the Hyperkin HEJ actually comes in massively closer to the OG stick than the Hori, though both are "GC style" sticks. But what does this mean for gameplay? Well, the answer is that the Hyperkin drop-in solution performs excellently. I have to say that while it does have the feel of a GameCube stick and a slightly tighter gate, the performance is incredibly true to what you would expect! There was no ghosting, no bad detections, no angular issues, and because of the enhanced grip of the GC-style nub, no slippery situations in the heat of battle (aka Perfect Dark simulants set to HardSim/ExpertSim).</p>
	<p><i>GoldenEye's</i> sniper rifle and R-button aiming felt great, Perfect Dark's shooting range felt exactly as I would expect, and purposefully inspecting turning circles in <i>Super Mario 64, 1080° Snowboarding</i>, and <i>Wave Race 64</i> felt excellent throughout. Even with that ever-so-tiny deviation from a perfect benchmark, it doesn't hinder anything in terms of quickly switching directions for wall jumps or swiftly inputting tricks to unlock the Panda or that pesky dolphin!</p>

	<p>The Hyperkin Hall Effect Joystick replacement module is a godsend. It's simple to install, excellent to use, and gives the added bonus of peace of mind with its magnetic technology, mitigating stick drift and droop forever!</p>
	<p>How it holds up in competitive environments remains to be seen, and I would love to hear the views of anyone who has used this stick in a competitive setting, or anyone who is innately tuned into a specific game to find out if it actually is as good as I think it is!</p>
	<p>Even if you aren't technically minded, this is a really simple mod to perform and shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes for even the least experienced people with a screwdriver to navigate. Just be sure to retain all the screws and dont be tempted to roughly tug out the PCB cable, else you might break something off internally or jostle the buttons out of place.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Bargain price & simple to install<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Zero drift or droop<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>GameCube-styled stick, N64-style gate<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Feels incredible in-game<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Excellent benchmark results</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Needs an "N64 style" version?<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Slightly yellowed colouration</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Hyperkin has made a product that does exactly what it says it will. It's £14.99; it replaces and upgrades the stick, and it feels superb to boot!</p>
	<p>My biggest question is: will they produce an "N64 style" version, or will we only ever see a "GameCube style" HEJ?</p>
