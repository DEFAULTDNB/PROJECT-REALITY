	<h4>Retro Revival</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Yesterday, at the 2024 Game Awards, Saber Interactive announced a fresh entry in the dinosaur hunting series: Turok Origins. Following on from the success of the recently remastered trilogy, Saber has gone back to its roots and taken the series in a familiar yet alternative direction.</p>
	<p>The last Turok title to grace our screens was made by Propaganda Games back in 2008 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows PC. That outing was loosely based on the comics and had a solid Unreal Engine 3-powered single-player campaign and online multiplayer. <i>Turok</i> (2008) was meant to kick start a reboot trilogy of the titular series, and while it initially sold well, it was met with lukewarm reviews, and the planned sequel was shut down even before Propaganda Games closed in 2011.</p>
	<p>Turok Origins, which has yet to be given a release date, shows a team of three looking to the skies as a ship looms into view, and then they seem to work together to take down several species of dinosaur, including Velociraptors, Allosaurs, and a fierce, corrupted-tech-looking boss Triceratops. Weaponry like tomahawks, knives, and machine guns are presented here too, though no series-staple sniper rifles or grenade launchers are shown off yet, so the possible destructive interactivity with the environments remains a mystery.</p>
	<p>There is a heady mix of technology and biology going on here too, with the main characters having suits that can activate like Tony Stark's Iron Man Mark L armour, possibly using some nanotechnology, revealing a reptilian-looking protective, textured material. Weapons such as the furtive bow and arrow look to be upgraded with sci-fi electricity-based twine and techy light arrows. Interestingly, there is also a scene with the protagonist lifting a dinosaur and slamming it to the ground with an organic Venom-like tendril, demonstrating new in-game mechanics and physics.</p>

	<h4>Shoulder Soldier</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The main shake ups of this initial trailer are that the game is taking on an over the shoulder third-person perspective. This leans into the idea of quick time events, some of which we see by way of the character stabbing a dinosaur through the head as it pounces to attack you.</p>
	<p>I wonder if the game will take on an asymmetical shooter theme, allowing teams of up to three to stalk the prehistoric predators and decimate any foes Saber Interactive have designed for this entry in the collective. There has been no mention of online cooperative or multiplayer yet, but hopefully that will be announced at somepoint to round off the game, and resurrect some Rage Wars </p>
	<p>Personally, I think it looks great. There is a definite Crysis-vibe to the looks and feel, with rain drops on the screen, bio-mechanical technological suits, and advanced weaponary mixed with raw firepower. As long as the game features and interesting story, plenty of dinosaurs, and gallons of blood; im hope Turok Origins will be a successfully nostalgic jaunt around the jungles and landscapes.</p>
	<p>You can watch the full trailer below, so please let me know what you think. Do you think Turok Origins will fare well in todays gaming landscape? What features would you like to see?</p>
