	<h4>Bear and Bird are Back!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> debuted in 2002, it's fair to say that fans were sceptical of the cell-shaded art direction. Today it's long forgotten that the GameCube's first Zelda title was meant to be a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask, and the cell-shaded look has retained the game's fresh, inviting, and youthful appearance.
	<p>Imagine then mashing up the opening environments of this GameCube title with the gameplay mechanics and characters of <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> and giving it all a fresh lick of paint for 2024. That's what Markus Kurko has done, and oh boy, has he done it well!
	<p>Staring at Outset Island on an N64 is something else! Scoping out the scenery, you can immediately recognise the DK Isles from <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and Koholint Island from <i>TLOZ:Link's Awakening</i> off on the horizon, as well as all the major POIs of Outset Island exactly where you would expect them to be!
	<p>The island itself is wonderfully fitting within the Banjo-Kazooie biome, and it feels as if you've just washed up there when the King of Red Lions explains your quest before you set out searching every nook and cranny for secrets.
	<p>The sheer amount of areas included in this mod is outstanding. Banjo and Zelda fans will certainly get a kick out of some of the secrets, easter eggs, and the exhilarating exploration it takes to open up everything.</p>

	<h4>Treasure Tracking Ahoy!</h4><hr>
	<p>Packed with 125 notes, 21 Jiggies, 20 skulls, and 12 honeycombs to find, the game also boasts 6 Jinjos and some truly mysterious puzzles to beat!
	<p>I put in a good hour or so playing it for the first time, and I managed to eke out just 5 Jiggies, 2 Jinjos, 5 honeycombs, 5 skulls, and a handful of the other collectables, but the puzzles are where I focused my time, and the majority are quite brilliant, to say the least.
	<p>Putting in 3+ hours I was sailing literally, you can sail around with the King of Red Lions! If you want an idea of how that works, <a href="blog.html#MKBWDX">check out the pre-release video linked here.</a>
	<p>Graphically, this game is a visual treat. On emulators, the game runs incredibly soothly with locked framerates and effects such as scanlines, if you so choose, but on a real console it runs as well as can be expected on the ageing hardware, which means there is a little slowdown here and there, but that's just how it was in 1998 and it's nostalgic to say the least!
	<p>Musically, the game also excels, with recognisable Zelda soundtracks reinvigorated through the Bajo-Kazooie soundfont, and they sound fantastic, even the pause screen music!

	<h4>A Match Made in Heaven</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> in the world of <i>TLOZ:Wind Waker</i> is quite frankly genius. The cartoony vibrancy and Zelda-Esq sense of adventure pair so well that it's hard to believe these games have never met before. This depiction of Outset Island acts as an awe-inspiring demake for Wind Waker but a superbly Deluxe modification of Banjo-Kazooie. As such, this mod is entirely worthy of your time if, like me, you're a collect-a-thon-a-holic!
	<p>Whats more, Kurko is offering personalised mods through his Patreon (linked below), with a "Golden Jiggy" edition offering two extra secret eggs and a "Custom Version" allowing you to specify items and bespoke dialogue to feature in your very own, individual, z64 ROM!
	<p><i>The Legend of Banjo-Kazooie The Bear Waker Deluxe</i> is available on early access TODAY and will be publicly released for everyone to download on August 7th!

	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Some small visual effects are garbled</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>This Deluxe edition of the Bear Waker is the strongest outing yet from Kurko_Mods. The game feels fresh and inviting, there are a lot of things to discover and unlock. Playing it on real hardware is a fantastic bonus too!
	<p>I would say that there are at least 2 hours of adventure packed into this mod, and every second of it has been crafted incredibly well by Kurko Mods!
	<p>My only minor quibble would be that some of the graphical effects, such as fire, egg launching, puffs of smoke, and shadows, seem to look garbled or incorrect at times, but apart from that one small gripe; it's an amazingly solid outing all round!
