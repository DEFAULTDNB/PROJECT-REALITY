	<h4>Yoko-Who-Na?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>64 Oozumou (64 ≈åzum≈ç)</i>, or "Sumo 64", attempts to simulate the life of a Sumo wrestler, from your first bouts until you become the yokozuna, through the medium of 64-bit grappling.</p>
	<p>Released in 1997, every aspect of the sport is covered, from your weigh-ins, dietary requirements, and matches. With 40+ characters, 30+ special moves, and eight arenas, the game has a lot to offer, but is it any good?</p>
	<p>After a short cutscene involving a train ride animation, and once you're through the menu-driven sections of the game, you eventually get to brawl; this is where the game opens up and becomes engaging, in my opinion. Fighting involves using combinations of the C buttons and the analogue stick to dust up your opponent, coming to the crescendo of launching them out of the ring.</p>
	<p>Like a mixture of Dance Dance Revolution and Tekken, you have to chain together button presses to weaken your opponent, and once their energy bar goes red, you'll have the opportunity to hirate (slap) or kimarite (throw) them out of the ring, propelling you through the ranks of public adoration.</p>
	<p>You seem to graduate your way up classes, into swankier venues, and eventually please your family to become the best of the best.</p>

	<h4>Super Sumo Stuff</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a European, I have not really experienced Sumo wrestling throughout my life. I know of it, but I couldn't name a single wrestler or honestly say that I have ever so much as watched a match.</p>
	<p>The characters are all individually styled, but the graphics are extremely basic. Only their eye style and hair and underwear colour differentiate them. Each character dances with extreme stiffness pre-fight, and the crowd is a static 2D facsimile of an audience. The game is pinned together with a storyline using in-game animation to convey characters talking and even having post-match interviews, but I couldn't grasp much of what was going on.</p>
	<p>If you were a Japanese citizen, with a healthy knowledge of Sumo, or can read Japanese text, this game could be more gripping. My main issue was the lack of a translation patch, so I muddled my way through, using a Google camera app to loosely translate screens as I played. The process slowed down the already slow-paced intermissions between bouts.</p>
	<p>One redeeming feature is that the game also features a multiplayer mode. This is the quickest way to enter an immediately entertaining mode featuring all-out thigh-slapping action. You can batter your mates to see who's the best, or play against CPU opponents to train up.</p>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Compelling combat system.<br>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Once you get into the matches, it's an engaging game, but too much fluff and too many stats only serve to repeatedly slow the game down. 64 Oozumou could have been better; it's simply too basic-looking and feeling to earn a higher score.</p>
