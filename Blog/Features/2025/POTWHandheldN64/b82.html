	<h4>Weekly Workflow</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>While doom-scrolling through TikTok this week, I noticed a pretty awesome project involving my favourite console of all time. Youtuber Project of the Week has been building a portable N64 using a Pi model 3B V1.2, and what's incredible about the build is that it incorporates everything into a trident controller!</p>
	<p>Having identified the build, I contacted Project of the Week on TikTok and discovered their fantastic YouTube channel. You can observe the process of the handheld N64 build in the video below:</p>

	<p>I do a lot of projects in my free time, so I have decided to record the process and learn from each other. I make original projects of ideas that occur to me, always related to software or hardware. I hope we all entertain each other. Thank you!</p>

	<p>Using a non-OEM USB controller, a Raspberry Pi 3b V 1.2 (though you can use a Pi 4), a 4" (800x600) LCD screen, and an HDMI connector, the build uses a custom 3D-printed housing for the screen to sit in, and the components are simply wired up within the confines of their new enclosure.</p>
	<p>Creating his own STL print files, the controller is fabricated on a Bambu Lab 3D printer, then assembled to fit all the components, and incorporates a handly power socket on the rear (where the Memory Pak slot would usually sit).</p>

	<h4>Hyperkin-Style Handheld</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Having spoken to the man behind Project of the Week, he genuinely had no clue that Hyperkin had already teased this kind of build, though the similarities are incredibly apparent. It shows that necessity breeds invention, and parallel evolution can occur, proving its brilliance of design!</p>
	<p>According to the maker, the battery life is around 6 hours with a 10,000 mAh battery tethered to it, and running <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi OS</a>, it is possible to play the <i>Super Mario 64</i> port without any issues.</p>
	<p>There is room for improvement by way of some small upgrades, such as the Pi itself could be upgraded to the Pi 5 and therefore the HDMI adapter to Micro HDMI, the screen to higher resolution, and perhaps even a touchscreen; but given that Project of the Week embarks on a new project each week, it's incredible to think that the entire thing has been brought to life in just one single seven-day cycle.</p>
	<p>It is also extremely easy to install an alternate operating system on this, such as Recalbox, and load it with all 388 games in the N64's library. That would be incredible!</p>
	<p>It would be interesting to see if this project could be refined further to incorporate the battery, to remove the need to carry the battery in your pocket while you play. Maybe a slimline series of batteries could be packed into the memory pak slot, but I think the weight would be a little heavy on the wrists. I think a better idea would be to hide them in the trident handles.</p>
