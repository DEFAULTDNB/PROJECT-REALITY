	<h4>A Mini Steering Controller</h4><hr>
	<p>I don't know why, but I've wanted one of these for a very long time. I think it's a mixture of morbid curiosity and a penchant for the weird and wonderful in the world of N64 controllers!
	<p>The Performance UltraRacer 64 is unlike anything you've probably seen before, with a singular handle to hold onto and a small foam encircled wheel mounted on the top. The wheel acts as the analog stick twisting left and right to steer, and it houses the four C-buttons at the summit of its form. The remainder of the buttons are sprinkled upon the top of the handle, in thumbs reach, but oddly, even they aren't as they seem. The cluster of blue and green buttons are NOT A or B buttons, instead, they are L/Z/R buttons with a bonus "Extra" green button as the fourth.
	<p>Underneath the handle is not a Z-trigger, it's the A and B buttons but in the form of a strange two-way-trigger; clicking upward for B, and clicking downward for A. This trigger also acts as the up and down analog stick controls. On the right hand side is a switch, and this one turns the A and B buttons on and off, and remaps them to the D-Pad left and right buttons. It's like Performance said, "Take every feature and turn it on its head", because not much on this controller makes sense.
	<p>The D-Pad buttons are just beneath the position of the main wheel, and again, in what I would consider odd order; Up, Down, Left, Right. I perhaps would have positioned them; Left, Up, Down, Right so that the cardinal directions matched up more with the edges of the controller, for ease of use? Towards the bottom of the prong are the Start and Set buttons, the latter of which can be used to programme 14 out of the 16 buttons on the controller, so you could completely remap it if you were so inclined!
	<p>Programming the buttons is simple: hold the Set button until it beeps, tap the button you want to change, followed by the button you want it to become. The pad beeps when beginning and again upon completion to indicate a successful programming. Reverting the pad back to default is achieved by holding A+L+R for several seconds upon turning the console on with it plugged in.
	<p>The wheel, is a very strange creature. It measures 2-inches across and fits nicely between your fingers with its squishy, foam-rubber surround. It turns just 45° clockwise and 45° anticlockwise, so it has a tight, responsive feel to it, but, and this is a big but: its responsiveness is questionable.

	<h4>Small Wheel Energy</h4><hr>
	<p>In order to test out this racing-centric controller, I chose the original racers on the console: <i>Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, F-Zero X</i>, and, for good measure, <i>World Driver Championship</i>.
	<p>For <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, <i>F-Zero X</i>, and <i>World Driver Championship</i> the UltraRacer 64 fared well overall. Steering around corners and navigating tracks feels good, but the buttons feel slightly off all around the controller. In any game menus, character or vehicle select, it's recommended to slide the A/B switch off so that you can use the D-Pad left and right buttons as the A and B buttons. Once the game commences you switch the slider back to the on position.
	<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> was pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to control. It was like skating on ice, the turning circle was almost nonexistent, and the characters glided effortlessly out of bounds when attempting to round any corner.
	<p>The biggest issue I had with this controller was the A/B slider/trigger controlling the analog Y-axis. I genuinely don't understand the design choices made to get this pad to function. It's so specific in its design towards racing games that it feels like Performance then tacked the rest of the features they omitted back on, through any bizarre way possible. 
	<p>Overall, the UltraRacer 64 has its merits for driving games specifically, but beyond that, it's purely chock full of gimmicks that sadly won't make this an essential purchase unless you are mad on racing games 24/7.

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Completely remappable<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Good, but exclusively for driving games</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Awful analog controls<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Questionable design</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The UltraRacer 64 is yet another oddity from the N64 era that now serves as a talking point collectable rather than a controller that you would choose to ever replace your OG trident. It's niche means that you should only reach for it when strictly playing car-based racing games.
