	<h4>When it comes to N64 gaming, what's your ReCollection?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I got my console day one, from Toys R Us, after patiently/impatiently waiting on the "if someone doesn't come collect theirs, you're next in line" list. 
	Without thinking, I bagged a console, <i>Super Mario 64</i>, and a green controller, though why I bought a second pad when SM64 clearly wasn't two-player is an enduring mystery.
	<p>I excitedly phoned my friend that evening and told him to come round ASAP to checkout the 3D graphics. The idea of doing homework was thrown to the wayside that night!
	<p>I have great memories of borrowing <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> off another friend, swapping out <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> for a bit. Turok was one of my first experiences of FPS games, and I loved every blood-soaked second of it!. 
	<p>I was in secondary school when the N64 released, so my friend-group had weekly meet-ups at each other's houses; to share and play whichever games we had purchased. We regularly held 4-8 player tournaments for <i>ISS, Killer Instinct Gold, Lylat Wars, Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye</i> to name but a few. 
	If it was during our lunch breaks: we were guaranteed to be late back to class.
	<p>Almost 30 years on, and I still play these games regularly, and I am now closing in on my attempt to collect a full world set of 388 titles. I have just 11 to go!</p>

	<h4>Why ReCollect64 exists:</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I found it a minefield to get an app that could let me check off my personal collection, tracking exact versions such as UKV as opposed to EUR or AUS instead of EUU. I have tried to collate as much information as possible into one resource, along with matching images for box art, cart labels, manuals, and accessories. 
	<p>N64 collection apps usually reside as phone apps that don't contain regional variants, every ROM revision, or even correct images to accompany all of them. 
	ReCollect64 aims to change this by bringing images, information, and a full-featured and customisable collection app to any device that has a web browser. 
	<p>N64 will always be my favourite console, and I'm proud to present the next iteration of my passion project, which is now known as ReCollect64! 
	<p>Whether you are reminiscing (recollecting) the nostalgia of the console, or embarking on collecting a specific set (re-collecting): you can use the site to do this and much more! 
	<h4>Why this Blog exists:</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The ReCollect64 Blog will regularly provide a distinct format with articles centering on the world of N64! 
	<p>Firstly, there will be weekly Q&A chats with prominent faces of the N64 world, giving an easy to read and light-hearted insight into who they are and what they're about!
	I have had a lot of support and plenty of willing victims messaging me to join in with the fun, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I already have more than 10 Q&A chats lined up!				
	<p>Secondly, I will be reviewing games, accessories, and merch relating to the Nintendo 64, both new and old whereever possible. If you have any suggestions or would like me to review something N64 related, my coms are always open (see below).
	<p>Lastly, there will be featured posts that contain news, ReCollect64 site updates, interesting modern developments, or simply reminiscing about the good old days.
	<p>Overall, this is simply a space for sharing neat things, memories and bathing in nostalgia, nothing too heavy. 
	<p>So please bookmark this site, spread the word, and check in from time to time to relax and unwind!
