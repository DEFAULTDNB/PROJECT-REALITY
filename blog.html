				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Quest64, or should I call you Brian/Mike?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Mike is fine, over the last few months we've become pretty friendly and it's nice to use a name üôÇ</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Shall we kick-off this Q&A by describing your Questing antics on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't think I really have a thing anymore to be honest. The overall goal is to make Quest 64 more visible on the internet in a memorable way, but the road to getting there is weird. 
				There are days where I focus on jarring people's memories about the Nintendo 64 and the games outside of the normal Goldeneye/Smash Bros/etc...posts you see all the time. 
				Other days it's talking about the retro gaming discourse and what we can do to improve it for everyone. A lot of times it's just Quest 64 memes and me chasing people around social media with pictures of Brian. 
				I like to keep it fresh.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The first system our family owned was an NES, my parents got it for my brother and I when I was 4/5 (early 89). It was an absolute blast and my Mom was super into it as well, 
				so a lot of my gaming memories and favorite games were ones I shared with her. She is the reason I have such a fondness for Bomberman, as Mega Bomberman on the Sega Genesis was a longtime favorite of hers.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have a lot of physical games, though I have been trying to shave my collection down as I get older. There was a point where I probably had between 4000/5000 physical games across all the systems.....
				but as time has passed I've sold/traded some of them to continue building my Nintendo 64 collection (and make more space in my house)</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Absolutely! It's the Nintendo 64! Another system my parents bought for me, and one we shared a bunch of memories with....something I'm trying to keep doing with my kids.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't have a routine for games, though obviously I play Quest 64 quite a bit lol. Most of my game time these days is games my kids want to play, so it's been a lot of ARMS, Animal Crossing, Roblox, Kirby Forgotten Land...and almost always on the Switch. 
				I still play a fair amount of Nintendo 64, but mostly games I didn't grow up with so I can familiarize myself with the entire library more.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My favorite go to snacks are all banana based. I like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, banana pancakes/bread and smoothies....but for traditional garbage food I'm fond of regular Lay's potato chips and Dr. Pepper. Really anything will do though, I'm a food hole.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't really thing there's one thing I hold above everything else. I have a fondness for Densha De Go pocket watches, so that's probably the most unique thing in my collection.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>This one is a moving target for me. There's not one thing I dream about, but when i find out that there's an article I want to read in a hard to find copy of Gamefan magazine or a official N64 soundtrack I've never seen before and isn't online.....
				I tend to get hyper-fixated.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>YES! The amazing people over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP" target="_blank">Quest 64 Speedrun Discord</a> were already working on a traditional decomp of the game, but the new Wiseguy tools are exciting and I hope to see Quest 64 make it's way to PC through a recomp sooner than later!</p></div>

				<p>You‚Äôre ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what‚Äôs your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm traditionally a cheese pizza guy, but if forced to pick three more toppings I would probably do onions, sausage and red chili flakes.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>How many games & consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have around 45 consoles but as for games, I have no idea anymore lol. I do have just over 500 N64 games, and the total games across all systems is probably north of 3500-4000. I really should go through and re-catalogue everything but that seems like such a job....especially when I really don't play a lot of them anymore.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What‚Äôs your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive game I every purchased was Super Bowling...I think I paid $250USD for it, but that money came from selling a bunch of Guitar Hero guitars during the pandemic to make space in my basement, so it was close to a wash. 
				The most thrifty thing came recently, I spent $1 at a thrift store on a Code Lyoko OST CD that regularly sells for north of $100. Hopefully I'll be trading that soon though as there are lots of people looking for it and that's not really my thing.</p></div>

			<h4>Who Doesn't Love a Bargain?</h4><hr>
			<p>When I saw the QuickShot NitroStick (yes that's what they called it!) for sale recently, at a ridiculously low price of just ¬£5, I jumped at the opportunity to add to my selection of oddball N64 accessories.
			<p> QuickShot made a few accessories in their time and this was perhaps their most specialised piece of input equipment for the N64, specifically having been made for the controlling of aircraft. 
			I dont know if you know this but there are only a handful of "flight-sim" games on the Nintendo 64 including <i>Buck Bumble, Lylat Wars (Star Fox), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, AeroFighters Assault</i> and <i>Pilotwings</i>, so there isn't much to pick from!
			<p>The NitroStick has the Z-Trigger on the rear as you would imagine, the A and B buttons are up on the top of the stick along with a hat-switch that acts as the D-Pad. On your left-hand side are the C-buttons, the L/R triggers in button form and the start/turbo/reset buttons too. 
			Lastly, on the underside resides a switch that converts the input from analogue to digital, so if a game requires D-pad input instead of stick input, you're sorted!
			<h4>It's Good, But Not Perfect</h4><hr>
			<p>QuickShot sadly didn't build this thing with games like <i>Lylat Wars</i> in mind, because the pew-pew button is not in the correct pace as you would hope, the Z-Trigger, its on the A button. You cant re-map the buttons either so it feels a little off, but on the other hand games like AeroFighters and even <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> utilise the Z-Trigger for your main guns and it feels superb!
			<p>Handling in-game feels nice, really nice, and the pitch and yaw of this stick really builds the immersion when playing games that best suit this equipment. In actual fact ANY game could theoretically be played with this controller, including <i>Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye,</i> or even <i>Zelda</i> if you REALLY wanted to, but I wouldn't. 
			Barring a couple of these fringe-case flight sims the NitroStick doesn't feel great for RPG/FPS/Platforming play, as the learning curve becomes huge, so stick to the perfectly formed trident-controller for those games!
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Feels great for flight games.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Exceptional precision.</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> No remappable buttons.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> Limited use for games.</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong><p>It's not for everyone, nor is it for every game, but I kind of like Quickshot's quirky stab at a realistic flight stick.

			<h2><span class="badge new">NEW</span> <span class="title">The iQue Player</span></h2>  
			<h5 class="subtitle">A plug-and-play N64 ~ May 29, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" alt="iQue" class="center"/></div>
				<h4>Interesting Retro Tech</h4><hr>
				<p>Not only will this site offer information on your favourite console, I also aim to fill your mind-hole with info on a plethora of accessories and interesting related devices too.</p>
				<p>In Y2K China's government imposed a ban on games consoles, so Nintendo had to think outside the box to crack the market. The iQue player is an oddity in that it is a console
				that is built into a controller, and it only plays N64 games that have been paid for and downloaded to the memory card. This system was to combat rampant piracy in China, 
				and it worked up until as recently as 2019, when it was hacked by Normmatt, Marshallh, Stuckpixel, Riley/ROL and SUXXORS.</p>
				<p>The iQue had just 14 games available in its life time, these were:
				<ul>
					<li>Animal Crossing<li>Custom Robo<li>Dr. Mario 64<li>Excitebike 64<li>F-Zero X
					<li>Mario Kart 64<li>Paper Mario<li>Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth<li>Star Fox 64
					<li>Super Mario 64<li>Super Smash Bros.<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<li>Wave Race 64<li>Yoshi's Island
				</ul>
				<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask</i> was meant to be release too, which even featured as a screenshot on the iQues box, but it never happened. Additionally a Traditional Chinese Translated 
				version of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was found ready for release in Taiwan (ROC) but it never happened.</p>
				<h4>A Beautiful Design</h4><hr>
				<p>When I bought mine in 2021 I was elated to have finally got my hands on one of my unicorns (I have a list I'll explain in another post). 
				The console was notably different feeling to an N64 controller, due to the missing middle prong and the more traditional form factor. It was smoother, sleeker heavier, and kind of nice! 
				I booted it up thinking that not a lot would happen, and luckily I had the paired memory card supplied with it. I was buzzing to find not only <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario</i>, but also <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>OOT</i>!.
				<p>The games are all localised in Chinese and so look incredibly different when they boot up, and I find that fascinating to observe!</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png"><img src="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				</span>
				<p>The iQue could be the ultimate way to play N64 games, for its simplicity and form factor. Nintendo sound definitely revisit this system-on-a-chip model if they ever make an N64 "classic" because it is ideal 
				for pick up and play and the analogue stick feels really nice too! The only caveat is lack of multiplayer without an additional device, but these days Nintendo could implement online instead, HDMI out, and possibly let you use your 
				Bluetooth N64 controllers for the Nintendo switch on it for local multiplayer.
				<p>The 64-bit possibilities are endless!

			<h5 class="subtitle">Hello World! ~ May 29, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Config/Images/ReCollect64.png" alt="HelloWorld" class="center" style="width: 300px; object-fit: contain;"/></div>
				<h4>When it comes to N64 gaming, what's your ReCollection?</h4><hr>
				<p>I got my console day-one, from Toys R Us, after patiently/impatiently waiting on the "if someone doesn't come collect theirs, you're next in line" list. 
				Without thinking, I bagged a console, <i>Super Mario 64</i> and a green controller, though why I bought a second pad when SM64 clearly wasn't two player is an enduring mystery.
				<p>I excitedly phoned my friend that evening and telling him to come round ASAP to checkout the 3D graphics. The idea of doing homework was thrown to the wayside that night!
				<p>I have great memories of borrowing <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> off another friend, swapping out <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> for a bit. Turok was one of my first experiences of FPS games, and I loved every blood-soaked second of it!. 
				<p>I was at secondary school when N64 released, so my friend-group had weekly meet-ups at each others houses, to share and play whichever games we had purchased. We regularly held 4-8 player tournaments for <i>ISS, Killer Instinct Gold, Lylat Wars, Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye</i> to name but a few. 
				If it was during our lunch breaks: we were guaranteed to be late back to class.
				<p>Almost 30 years on and I still play these games regularly, and I am now closing in on my attempt to collect a full world set of 388 titles. I have just 12 to go!</p>

				<h4>Why ReCollect64 exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>I found it a minefield to get an app that could let me check off my personal collection, tracking exact versions such as UKV as opposed to EUR or AUS instead of EUU. I have tried to collate as much information as possible into one resource, along with matching images for box art, cart lables, manuals and accessories. 
				<p>N64 collection apps usually reside as phone apps that don't contain regional variants, every ROM revisions or even correct images to accompany all of them. 
				ReCollect64 aims to change this by bringing images, information and a full featured and customisable collection app to any device that has a web browser. 
				<p>N64 will always be my favourite console, and I'm proud to present the next itteration of my passion project, which is now known as ReCollect64! 
				<p>Whether you are reminiscing (Recollecting) the nostalgia of the console, or enbarking on collecting a specific set (Re-Collecting): you can use the site free of charge to do this so please bookmark it, share the word and enjoy the app at your leisure.
