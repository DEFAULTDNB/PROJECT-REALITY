	<h4>Sensational Scenery</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>It's not often I cover something PS4 or PS5 related on ReCollect64, but for this I wanted to make an exception because I spotted a captivating cameo from a double act from the N64 era: Banjo & Kazooie!</p>
	<p><i>Trips Voyage</i> is a feature-rich, professional-grade 90's-inspired 3D platformer that has been produced in <i>Dreams</i> for PlayStation 4 by Eupholace (William Butkevicius). The game can also be played on PlayStation 5 for owners of <i>Dreams</i> via backwards compatabilty too!</p>
	<p>For those who are unaware, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dreams/" target="_blank">Dreams</a> is a suite of design tools for the PlayStation 4, produced by Media Molecule of <i>Little Big Planet</i> fame, that allows players to play, create, and share digital creations with other players around the world through a creative global portal.</p>
	<p>With these tools, it is possible to build lavish works of art, paint, sculpt, create music, animate, and even craft entire games with custom models, textures, scenery, objectives, logic, and even create VR-enabled games for the OG PSVR hardware!</p>

	<p>Game creator, <a href="https://x.com/eupholace" target="_blank">Eupholace</a>, has worked diligently for three years to make the game as polished and playable as possible. The game stars Trip, a dashingly daring feline who has to run, jump, and explore, collecting bells, rubber duckies, and golden anchors, in colourful three-dimensional worlds inspired by games such as <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, <i>Yooka-Laylee</i>, and <i>Super Mario Oddyssey</i>.</p>
	<p>You have abilities, collectables, costumes to unlock, googly-eyed objects, and NPCs to interact with. There are bespoke worlds such as "Tropic Trove", "Glassy Glacier", and "Sun-dried Sea" that each demonstrate unique biomes and individual atmospheres through stage-specific mechanics, lighting, elemental effects, and incredible sound design throughout.</p>
	<p>In other words, the game that has been built within a game, is a professional-standard, Rare-inspired technical marvel that shows an eye for detail, smart level design, adorable character crafting, and overall aesthetic polish that will truly make your jaw drop.</p>

	<p>As you can see, the game has been modified (within Dreams) to accommodate Banjo the bear, Kazooie the breegull, the honeycomb, jiggies, and notes on the HUD that we have come to know and love. The stance of Banjo, the flight of Kazooie, and the graceful cooperation of the two have been captured with such clarity and perfection that you would be forgiven for thinking that this is the latest game from the now Microsoft-owned game studio, Rare!</p>
	<p>The model, or puppet, is the combined work of <a href="https://x.com/eupholace" target="_blank">Eupholace</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Piece_of_Craft" target="_blank">Piece_of_Craft</a> and certainly looks the part. Banjo has every intricate detail, down to his nails, iconic tooth necklace, and buckled-up blue backpack. Kazooie is fully feathered with her gorgeous gradient colouration, and she even has the little plume atop her head.</p>

	<h4>Nostalgic Notes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In the demonstration video that Eupholace posted, we can see the characters movement animations that pay homage to Rare's trademark style perfectly.</p>
	<p>To add to the effect, they have put some incredibly melodic music over the teaser. The "Treasure Trove Kove" score (seen in the "Tropic Trove" level) was arranged by Thomas Kresge for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZy2mMSsI5tJP2nF2ognaCQ" target="_blank">The Game Brass</a> and composed by and featuring none other than Grant Kirkhope, and you can listen to the track in full here:</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nmQrN_encs"></iframe></center>
	<p>Overall, the game's production value is above and beyond anything you could have believed was achievable in <i>Dreams</i>, and the possible addition of beautifully produced, instantly recognisable characters like Banjo and Kazooie, layers in the nostalgia for those of us who grew up playing on the Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p>I'm crossing my fingers that this mod gets released to the public because it's simply way too cool for the designers to keep to themselves!</p>
	<p>If you have a PlayStation 4 or 5, a copy of Dreams, and certainly if you're a fan of Rares platformers, then it's an absolute no-brainer; go check out <i>Trips Voyage</i> today!</p>
