	<h4>Rings of Fire</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Those of you who have had the displeasure of playing <i>Superman 64 The New Superman Adventures</i> on the Nintendo 64 will no doubt agree that it is one of, if not the worst games available on the system. Why then, would someone have the impetus to play it nowadays? What if I told you that you could don the cape and play the 64-bit aesthetic recreation of the game through a first-person perspective in virtual reality!</p>
	<p>As insane as this all sounds, two years ago (2022) simulation artist Peter Stolmeier, also known as Wackomedia, went to the trouble of remaking the mazes and traps over on itch.io, proving that quite literally everything is better in VR!</p>
	<p>Here is a list of the game's features:</p>
		<div class="container">
		&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
		<p>Only the first 3 maddening mazes and terrible traps are included. More can be added if there is interest but this is as far as most players got originally.</p>
		<p>Practice mode is now meant to showcase the MASSIVE square mile of city.</p>
		<p>Since flying is now smooth I removed the ability to skip rings, you have to hit every one. I also moved the collider in a little so you have to be inside the ring for it to count.</p>
		<p>I‚Äôve placed the HUD onto the players wrists and added the ability to turn them off by pushing a physical button they are being projected from.</p>
		<p>I wanted to keep as much jank as I could. The car sequence breaks modern immersion conventions a little to keep the mechanic the same, expect to have to try that a few times before you get it and yes, that means you have to start over at the rings again.</p>
		<p>There is no health bar and if I make more levels I don‚Äôt plan on adding it. The countdowns and danger to citizens is enough of a challenge. I will probably make powers permanent as well, all drawing from a central battery that the pickups will refill.</p>
		<p>Now that this is a first person game there‚Äôs no player model, this lets me remove any reference to Superman and it‚Äôs trademarked characters, something I think DC comics and its parent company Warner Brothers will appreciate.</p>
		<p>You are now playing as Super Human Six!  I had to change very little to make this possible, you might not even notice other than the cover.</p>
		<p>Finally, I changed the ending, or rather created one because the original game just used the static opening models again. It was only 20 seconds long and is seriously lazy, there is no back wall of this set and they just SHOW THE HOLE ON SCREEN. The camera shook so bad because they didn‚Äôt turn it off on the previous level. A level that concludes with a sign that reads ‚Äúthe end‚Äù.</p>
		<p>My version also has a "the end" sign but at least it's graphically interesting.</p>

	<h4>Super Sideloading</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game for standalone VR headsets, which is available via the itch.io link below, is 480MB in size, which is around 475MB bigger than the N64 ROM file, and contains the entire Metropolis map, lovingly recreated, from scratch, by Wackomedia.</p>
	<p>The game features the main mode and a practice session, where you can fly to your heart's content. The author also came up with an amusing little, copyright-dodging, storyline to accompany the experience:</p>  
		<div class="container">
		&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
		<p>The villainous Luther Lexington has kidnapped your friends Luis Street, Jamie Alyson, and Professor NoJoan Carez and sent them to a virtual world.</p>
		<p>It's up to you, Super Human Six, to jack in and save them.</p>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
		</div>
	<p>Playing the games as Super Human 6 instead of the titular Man of Steel, you get to begin by jumping into the <i>Stargate</i>-like portal, just like you did on the N64! The actual game itself has a massively better draw distance, far less fog, the timer handily available on your left wrist, your compass on the right, and the colours and textures are far more high-resolution, brighter, and more vibrant. You can still land and jankily launch cars, rescuing innocent civilians and preventing their untimely deaths.</p>
	<p>Having given this a go by sideloading the content on my Quest 3, I have to say its quite playable. The sensation of flying is far better portrayed in VR than it ever could have been on the N64, and the game is actually quite enjoyable.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the entire game is merely minutes long, taking far less than half an hour to complete fully, but Wackomedia saw fit to put the entire credits list for the original game in his version, which I commend thoroughly.</p>
	<p>If you would like to try it out for yourself on a Windows PC (PCVR) or on Android-powered VR headsets such as the Meta Quest 2 or 3, you can do so here:</p>
