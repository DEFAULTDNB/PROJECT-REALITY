	<p>Have you ever seen people playing crazy mods, translations, or cheat-enriched versions of your favourite games on emulators or flashcarts? Ever wondered how to patch a ROM for yourself? Considering it's illegal in most regions to distribute ROMs, developers are prone to sharing just the patch files necessary to modify a base ROM into something else.</p>
	<p>The principle is simple, take a verified ROM, for example "Mario Kart 64 (U) [!].z64", CRC check it (CRC32: 434389C1), obtain the patch in one of the possible formats (*.BPS, *.IPS, *.UPS, *.APS, *.RUP, *.PPS, *.MOD, *.XDELTA or *.VCDIFF, for example), and unify them into one playable file.</p>
	<p>Prior to web-based tools, you had to download something like xDelta or FLIPS/Lunar to your PC, run it, load your ROM, patch it, and then you could finally admire your handy work. Now, there is no need to download tools or even use a PC; anything with a suitable browser will do!</p>
	<p>Here is a quick list of the online patchers for you to peruse:</p>

	<h4>ROMhacking.net</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As many of you may know, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/news/3074" target="_blank">ROMhacking.net</a> is closing its doors after 20 glorious years, which is a horribly significant blow to the hacks scene, but all is not lost, as <a href="https://archive.org/details/romhacking.net-20240801" target="_blank">archive.org</a> has the majority (not everything) backed up and ready to go.</p>
	<p>What needs to happen now is an open-source solution that allows modders to share patches and will let you patch your ROMs directly on the site.</p>
	<p>I did briefly consider looking into making a rudimentary web-based JS patcher for <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/" target="_blank">ReCollect64</a>, but so many already exist I don't feel its worth it. Instead, I am championing those that exist and ones in active development, such as Marc Rolbedo's ROM Patcher JS version 3.0, which not only patches but will encapsulate the patches and merely await the ROM to be loaded.</p>

			<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If RHDN shutdown brought anything positive is that I&#39;m totally focused in Rom Patcher JS 3.0, which will bring MASSIVE improvements for those who want to self-host their patches and provide a custom patcher.<br>It is going to be easier to embed and more customizable than ever.

	<p>As a concept, this is fantastic, allowing anyone to embed the patcher within their site, hosting only the legal patches, and letting the end user patch their own legally obtained ROMs.</p>
	<p>Hopefully the people responsible for creating this plethora of patches won't be too discouraged by ROMhacking.net's departure, and will find a new hub from which to share their works of art.</p>
	<p>With creators like <a href="https://twitter.com/Litronom" target="_blank">Litronom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Markus_Kurko" target="_blank">Kurko Mods</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GoldeneyeMods" target="_blank">GoldenEye Mods</a> bringing forth huge, new mods regularly, rest assured, I will cover those here on ReCollect64 Blog too!</p>
