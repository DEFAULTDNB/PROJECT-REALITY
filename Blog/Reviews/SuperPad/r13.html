	<h4>Super or Pooper?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I'm back once again with an InterAct peripheral for review. Today we have yet another strangely shaped, but upwardly able, controller from the third-party vendor: the Super Pad 64!
	<p>The Super Pad, as the name implies, attempts to think outside the box to give players an alternative to the plethora of trident controllers that would have swamped them in the late 90s. This controller has the usual sleek black finish of InterAct's peripherals, and the usual level of "WTF were they thinking" character about its design language.
	<p>Beginning with the grip of the controller, it is certainly unique, with its left-hand side cupped perfectly in your left hand and its right prong thrusting your palm away to make the face buttons more ergonomically suited. I guess the old method of holding a piece of clay and reshaping it until it feels right in your hand was the overarching design method for the Spuer Pad, as this organic and wonky form factor simply couldn't have been devised any other way by mere humans.
	<p>Having said that, when you hold the controller, you feel a little bit like you're holding the middle and right prongs of an OG trident controller, so there is definitely some method to InterActs creative madness.
	<p>It looks freaky, but actually it fits in your hands with a distinctiveness that made me completely reconsider how good it actually could be. For most racing, platform, and action games, this is a reasonable controller, and even fighting game enthusiasts should appreciate the layout.

	<h4>So Right, it's Wrong</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The InterAct Super Pad is a very strange creature. The shere A-Symmetry of the controller leaves you adjusting your grip at first, with your left middle finger naturally settling on the Z-Trigger naturally, though I would have preferred to see dual triggers on each side because nowadays, with the power of console hindsight, your right middle finger sits there entirely devoid of function on this controller.
	<p>The two biggest caveats with this controller are the analog stick and the D-Pad because both are underwhelming. The stick feels too tall and, weirdly, too slender, whereas the D-Pad is too clicky, and not massively comfortable. Thank goodness <i>Street Fighter 3</i> never made it on to the N64 because if you used this to play, you would either snap your stick or wear every layer of skin off of your thumb even attempting to pull off a Hadouken!
	<p>It's not all doom and gloom; the controller has its ups and downs, such as the arcade-style 6-button layout of the A+B+C-buttons being brilliantly placed, and though the Z-trigger is ergonomically sound, it does feel awful to press.
	<p>For FPS titles, this feels like a proto-standard controller, it's leaning into some new ideas that have now become the industry norm, but it still has its whacky DNA undulating and protruding slightly too much for my liking. If it had toned it down a little and went a little more sensible with its core components, this could have been a way better product.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Surprisingly comfortable<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Superb button placement<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>A fan favourite!</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Sub-par stick and D-pad</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Stick prone to cracking/breaking</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I picked this one up for about £9 on eBay, including postage, a while back and I haven't used it much because it simply doesn't push all my buttons. For me, it's a little too whacky and a little too over-designed for its own good. I'll stick to the Hori Mini Pad thanks!</p>
