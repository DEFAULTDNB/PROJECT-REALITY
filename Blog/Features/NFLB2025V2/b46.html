	<h4>The Snap!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Following the previous releases of NFL Blitz 2024 V2 and NFL Blitz 2024: Gold Edition, <a href="https://x.com/NFL_Blitz_Rez" target="_blank">NFL Blitz Resurrection</a> have today posted their midseason V2 roster update of the 2025 American Football ROM hack.</p>
	<p>In the NFL, players are traded, signed, or even terminated, and team rosters are regularly updated to reflect the changes. This year the trade window closed on November 5th, so today's updated hack aims to compile all the latest changes in one neat package. Since the game last released on N64 with NFL Blitz 2001 SE, which was a Blockbuster Video exclusive title, it has been a full 23 years, but the N64 is still enjoying fresh, albeit unofficial, revisions!</p>
	<p>The latest rosters can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/sitemap/html/rosters/2024/" target="_blank">official NFL site</a>, and each team has been curated with the latest jersey numbers, player names, and statistics to give the game a fresh spin for 2024/25. According to the developers, every team except Atlanta had changes made, so expect lots of updates!</p>

	<h4>Hail Mary's</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>NFL Blitz forms one of my favourite N64 recollections, as my friend and I used to regularly play between classes back when we were in sixth form college. I'm not going to lie, we bunked off a lot of lessons in order to play N64, but I have particularly fond memories of playing the <i>NFL Blitz</i> games, baseball with <i>Ken Griffey Jr</i>, and the NHL titles, which is odd for UK kids to be into American sports, but we loved the crunching tackles and faster pace of the games.</p> 
	<p>Sadly, my friend passed away in 2011, but I know he would have loved to see this mod flourish just as much as I do. I quite often replay N64 games and their subsequent sequels on other consoles and wonder just what he would think of them and the state of the games industry today. The world, and the gaming landscape, is a far different place just 13 years on.</p>
	<p>The hack is currently available on NFL Blitz Resurrection's Twitter bio, along with some snazzy cover art, a cart label, and the *.Z64 ROM ready to play on compatible emulators or flashable cartridges.</p>
