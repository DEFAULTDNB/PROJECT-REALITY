	<h4>Logical Choices?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Logic 3 (or Logic3) used to be a big name in peripherals in the 90s, with N64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Dreamcast accessories out the wazoo! Nowadays they are mostly unheard of, but their legacy of third-party controllers, rumble packs, and memory cards lives in through eBay and respective local area selling sites.</p>
	<p>Avaliable in a range of transparent colours, the hiply named Logic 3 "6T4" pad was yet another in a long line of unofficial peripherals that wanted you to buy them over the official Nintendo offerings. Nintendo's trident controller was licensed, so these unlicensed versions could bear no resemblance to the OG controllers in any way shape or form, other than containing the same number of buttons, using a similar colourscheme, and connecting to the console using the proprietory connector.</p>
	<p>Logic 3 went for, in my opinion, one of the most uninspired designs I have ever seen on the N64, with the 6T4 pad delivering absolutely zero design flare and showing flagrant disregard for ergonomics or comfort. Instead, they came up with a controller that looks as uncomfortable as it feels!</p>
	<p>Testing this controller out on a couple of games, such as <i>Mario Kart 64 and GoldenEye 007</i>, I noticed a lot of judder on the stick and a peculiar gate to the overal shape of the 6T4 pads analogue range. When benchmarked, I noted a strange oval-shaped result. This indicates that the up and down range is too large and the left and right range is too small. This means that turning felt cumbersome while tilting up and down felt slightly too quick and therefore less controllable.</p>

	<h4>6T4 H8RZ</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The 6T4 pad has no redeeming features, and I say this kindly. The controller doesn't try to add or subtract anything from the base description of the OG N64 controller, nor does it attempt to innovate in any one single direction, whilst ensuring that it also doesn't inadvertently redesign the wheel, so to speak.</p>
	<p>What really bugs me about it is the way that none of my fingers want to sit cleanly on any of the buttons. It's like they wanted to spark arthritis in the hands of anyone who dared use this by forcing you to adjust your muscle memory into something unnaturally cramp-inducing.</p>
	<p>The plastic casing on the controller is chunky and bubbly to the touch, so much so that the controller does not sit nicely in the palms of your hands if you cup the outer sides as you think you should. Instead, you must hold the controller towards the tips of your fingers, with just the corner of the prong sitting uncomfortably in the divit of your hand; otherwise you'll end up hitting the left or right shoulder buttons with the completely wrong segment of your index fingers, and your thumb will completely miss the A and B buttons entirely.</p>
	<p>It's a real shame about this controller, because the stick feels nice and snappy, and the D-Pad, though miniscule, feels notably clicky and feels "ok" in games that require a lot of D-Pad action. If you can find it with your modified thumb placement.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Transparent design is a plus<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Slow & Turbo buttons</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Uncomfortable grip</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Poor analog stick benchmark</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Horrible design language</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>This is probably the worst of the worst so far. I wouldn't even wish this on your annoying little siblings who used to force their way into your room to play on your shiny new N64 back in the 90s. The 6T4 pad is an atrocity.</p>
