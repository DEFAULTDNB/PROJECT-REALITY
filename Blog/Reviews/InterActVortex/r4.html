	<h4>Far From Plane, Wheely Weird</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Let me guess; you just looked at the banner image and said to yourself, "What the $&%# is that thing?!". I did too when I first saw the InterAct Vortex controller for N64, but it didn't stop my hunting one down and bagging one, for the insanely low price of just £10!
	<p>The Vortex is an enigma, even to those who know about it. It's half steering wheel, half flight stick, and half controller, making it 150% insane. Starting with the controller aspect, you have to un-dock the controller portion from the mounting bracket via a square metal peg, and once you have just the controller in your hands, you will be quite disgusted at its chunky, unflattering and un-ergonomic form.
	<p>It is quite literally horrible to hold, and to make things worse, its vastness and unwieldy edges make it uncomfortable to grab on to for long periods of time. The button placement is good, and the shoulder buttons are there, but where is the Z-Trigger and the actual analog stick? Well, I'll get to those gripes later. The whole thing feels plasticy, it has squared-off sides, and it's far too burly to grip. It reminds me of the OG Xbox controller, the Duke, it's far too big, but at least the Duke had comfortable curves.
	<p>Connecting it back to its mount you get an idea for its steering pedigree. While the mount has ZERO buttons or functions, the square metal peg pushes into the back of the controller, and the device regains its analog abilities. The switch on the front right controls the analog modes, and you have the option to use it as a wheel or as a flight stick, the latter meaning if you tilt the whole thing towards you or away from you, you will rise or fall, just like a plane's yoke. Back in the 1990s this must have seemed so space-age, but today it's a stark reminder of how NOT to make a hybrid controller, I mean; how many things like this have you seen for modern consoles?</p>

	<h4>It's no Yoke: It's Bad!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Vortex is a jack of all trades but the master of none. Not one. It offers so much and looks fantastically "90s-modern", but it squanders its potential in every direction.
	<p>Using the controller, most games control ok, but you're missing the analog stick and an L/R or Z-trigger depending on what position the switch on the bottom left is set to. Not to worry because the J button acts as a surrogate for whichever button you misplace, but that button is rock solid.
	<p>To give it a varied test I fired up <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i>, <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, and <i>Hexen</i> using the three available setups. <i>Mario Kart 64</i> admittedly controlled well in steering mode, and using the toggle on the top right I could adjust sensitivity on the V-Axis. <i>Knife Edge</i> was a mixed bag, with the sensitivity and inversion throwing me right off, however, in-game you can alter the settings to make it far more controllable and enjoyable.
	<p><i>Hexen</i>, on the other hand, was hilarious to essentially drive around, with flight controls. Pushing forward moves the analog stick forward to walk, while tilting to the left or right turns the protagonist, so for a hot minute it was quite fun! The auto-fire and slow-motion buttons worked fine; however, I found that the "Direction Control Knob", or D-Pad, was very quick to rapidly fire off when even so much as slightly held down in any direction, and I could not seem to turn that off or prevent it from happening.
	<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Vortex also features its very own rumble mechanism, which requires 2xAA batteries inserted into the rear. It has a small switch on the back of the pad to select rumble mode or save mode, though why it can't rumble whilst saving to a memory card in the slot is beyond me. Another swing, and another miss!

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Interact DID make decent accessories in the 90s but this is NOT one of them, this one's having an identity crisis! The Vortex looks the part and has all the gear; but absolutely no idea what it even is, or what it really wants to be?!</p>
