	<h4>Video Games, Visual Frames</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>In an effort to switch up the pace of the site, I'm starting something new for ReCollect64, which may help enable me to fund future purchases of bigger and better items for review on the site.<p>
	<p>As a collector of games, merch, and memorabilia, I wanted to put out something simple yet nostalgic, resourceful, and aesthetically pleasing, so with that I am proud to present my N64 Game Frames!</p>
	<p>My ethos behind these products is to use destroyed magazines to preserve and display their information and to thin my collection out of doubles and carts with "character", so everything here will be legitimate, official games and clippings, but presented in an economical way to allow you to simply gift them to yourself or your loved ones.</p>
	<p>I have already sold a few on other marketplaces, and no two items will ever be identical because of the way they are sourced and combined.</p>
	<p>Please have a browse and <a href="mailto:recollect64official@gmail.com" target="_blank">feel free to contact me at any time if you have any enquiries or any ideas on custom commissions.</a></p>

	<h4>Detailed Disclaimers</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Items are subject to change and availability. No two will ever be identical so it's strictly first come, first served.
			<li>Carts are non-reproduction and therefore are almost 30 years of age, so they may display wear and tear, discolouration, or the cartridge may no longer operate.
			<li>These are primarily being sold as art pieces for the purposes of display and are not being advertised as functional games.
			<li>Feel free to ask me for further pictures of the items if you are unsure of the condition of the cartridges.
			<li>Please enquire about custom commissions through my contact email if you have an idea for a frame that you would like made.
			<li>Shipping will be calculated individually depending on your country of residence, and includes packaging costs and tracking.
			<li>You can pay extra for shipping insurance if you would like to, but please make that clear at the time of sale.
			<li>Please allow adequate time for shipping, especially taking into account public holidays and weekends.
			<li>Payment can be made by PayPal or bank transfer. I will contact you with the relevant information at the time of sale.
			<li>Proceeds will go towards the site and will be used for purchasing items for review or a coffee or two to keep me going.
