	<h4>The A-Z of N64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Historically, a multitude of companies and individuals have attempted to resurrect the fifth-generation console in a variety of ways, shapes, and forms. But how may have pushed the boundaries or produced anything of note?</p>
	<p>Modders have wowwed us with bespoke handheld builds, we have been amazed by the abilities of FPGA, and the majority of portable android and linux emulation devices now handle N64 with ease, so why is the N64 so hotly toyed with in console form, and where can we get our hands on these precious items of power?</p>
	<p>From Analogue's newly announced </i>Analogue 3D</i> through to the <i>Warrior 64</i> and beyond, I'm going to take a brief look into each of them, how they perform, and where they are today.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h4>Analog 3D</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I covered the <a href="Blog/Features/Analogue3DAnnounce/b37.html" target="_blank">announcement of the Analogue 3D on ReCollect64 back in October</a>, but what do we know about the system and why is it important to look at now?</p>
	<p>The Analogue 3D is set to be the first commercial, fully FPGA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array" target="_blank">Field-Programmable Gate Array</a>) hardware that supports existing Nintendo 64 cartridges and accessories while at the same time outputting at 4K, allowing Bluetooth accessories to be paired, and promising true region-free!</p>
	<p>As a collector of cartridges, this option appeals to me massively. I have carts from NTSC-J/NTSC-U/PAL and even Brazillian M-Pal (NTSC/PAL 525 lines/60Hz hybrid) regions, so it would be incredible to get to plug-and-play any of these without needing to swap consoles or use cables and adaptors to ensure full colour.</p>
	<p>My biggest questions are: will it support all accessories, will it also work with SummerCart64 or EverDrive 64 X7 flash carts, and will it get a custom firmware to dump and run games to and from an SD card? The answer is probably yes!</p>
	<p>Also, will the ability to play real cartridges drive up the resale prices of N64 games for collectors like me? It remains to be seen, though it wasn't the case when the Polymega N64 module released. Regardless, if Analogue lives up to their promises as they have previously with the Duo/Pocket/Mega SG/Super NT/NT Mini hardware, then N64 players are going to be in for a treat when it releases next year for $249.99!</p>

	<h4>Polymega EM05</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The RetroBlox was announced in 2017 as an attempt by console developers to unify all consoles into one using a console that could be adapted and recombined to read all sorts of legitimate cartridges and discs of games from yesteryear. As a concept, it was incredible, but in reality, the now renamed Polymega, by Playmaji, was a device that was impossible to get due to constant delays and shortages, and it cost an absolute arm and a leg to buy along with its additional components.</p>
	<p>The system currently supports PlayStation, TurboGrafx-CD, Neo Geo CD, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, NES, Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, SNES, and most recently, Nintendo 64. Essentially, this is an x86 PC running emulation with modular readers and connectors to bridge the games to the console. It's very clever, especially the CD-ROM reading aspect, as it had never been done before on x86 hardware.</p>
	<p>The EM05 Ultra Module Set is an add-on for the Polymega's base unit that extends its functionality to work with N64 games and accessories. It provides a cartridge slot and four controller ports when docked to the base unit, and you have the ability to dump your games to an internal drive to play them later.</p>
	<center>
		<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Features/AlternativeN64s/Polymega.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/AlternativeN64s/Polymega.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
	</center>
	<p>At £438.48 for the base unit and a further £71.08 for the Ultra module with one controller, you're looking at spending over £500 on hardware to use it for N64 games before you've even purchased a single cartridge for it. Add an additional £69.48 on top of that as well (£23.16x3) if you want to have four matching (Hori Mini Pad-style) controllers in total!</p>
	<p>Given that it's emulation-based 1080p gaming, I feel that the cost far exceeds the fun, and if you don't own a game, you can never play it on the system because it doesn't accept pirated ROMs or even flash carts. Each game you dump is tied to putting the cartridge back in each time you want to play it for verification. Also note that no free games are packed in with the N64 module either, whereas all other modules have free games bundled with them.</p>
	<p>For far less money, unscroupulous people could just opt for a Raspberry Pi 5 with an SD card and a couple of Bluetooth controllers, skipping the need for anything fancy and avoiding spending over £100 to play every N64 game under the sun, and running up to 4K resolution. Though you lose any ability to use real hardware and accessories altogether and you'll be forever branded a dirty pirate.</p>

	<h4>Portable Prototype: Hyperkin</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This one really got me hyped, and then it vanished into thin air. Around 2017, this surfaced as a concept, something Hyperkin confirmed that they were floating the idea of, and they built this prototype, but apparently they weren't confident of it being too popular during the research and development stages.</p>
	<p>The reality of this design is very odd, with the widescreen and 16:9 aspect ratio on good old 4:3 <i>Super Mario 64</i> there, and this thing probably ate batteries faster than the speed of light. The idea to implant a screen on top of an N64 controller, forging an Nvidia Shield-looking portable console that is playable on the go by just one player at a time, is clever, but where are the shoulder buttons? Have they just been chopped down to accommodate the screen? Also, were there more controller ports and a kick-stand on the back to play tabletop multiplayer?</p>
	<p>My biggest quibble is how heavy that would have been on your wrists. The image demonstrated a cartridge plugged into the back of it, but was that only there for effect? Many refuse to believe that you could shrink an N64 motherboard to fit into a controller (alongside the controller gubbins), with a battery, with heat dissipation, with a 4MB expansion pak, and everything else it needs to function. Though this was a concept from 7 years ago, and retro handhelds capable of solid N64 emulation probably didn't exist, so how did they do it?</p>
	<p>Well, the <a href="Blog/Features/iQue/b2.html" target="_blank">iQue player by Nintendo</a> actually did the majority of this way back in 2003! All it was lacking was a screen and a power pack.</p>
	<p>I think it's more likely that if a product like this were to ever surface, it would have been far more closely related to the DNA of the iQue player, with the redesigned N64 controller, small form factor, and SOC capable of playing expansion-enhanced games too.</p>

	</center>
	<p>Had this product been greenlit by Hyperkin and/or endorsed by Nintendo, would I have bought it? Probably. It's pretty badass and reminds me of Benjamin Heckendorn's incredible console contraptions.</p>	
	<p>Nowadays, almost all retro handheld portable consoles by Anbernic or Retroid can easily handle N64, with additional TV output, casting, bluetooth, wifi multiplayer, etc., for far less than this thing would have cost to buy, and without the hassle of carrying game paks with you everywhere you go.</p>

	<h4>Nintendo 64 Classic Mini</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If Nintendo had wanted to, they could very easily have built an "Nintendo 64 Classic" console to sit in line with their NES and SNES Classic console range. The fact that they didn't still baffles me today, as it was such a lucrative money spinner for them that it seemed odd to stop at the SNES, but definitely obvious that they wouldn't get to the GameCube.</p>
	<p>As mentioned above, the iQue Player by Nintendo was essentially a trimmed-down Nintendo 64 that could load games off its own proprietory memory card, but Nintendo could very easily have turned this into a miniconsole with controller sockets and a fake cart in the top.</p>
	<p>
	<center>
		<a target="_blank" href="Accessories/iQue A1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
	</center>	
	<p>Sadly, I think we probably will not see this device come to fruition, but with the 30th anniversary of the hardware looming in 2026, I am crossing my fingers that something might happen to reinvigorate the Classic Mini Console market.</p>
	<p>Nintendo could even repurpose the iQue player and its peripherals, namely the swim box, to build a simple NSO-powered N64 Classic Mini console that supports couch multiplayer. The NSO service could tie together accounts neatly, only needing one login across Nintendo Switch Online, the new Nintendo Music app, and N64 Classic, while using the online service to distribute additional ROMs to the system, as they release on NSO too. I could envision this as an alternative to having to buy a Nintendo Switch to play N64 games, but it plays them better thanks to using real hardware and zero emulation issues.</p>
	<p>Meh, I can dream!</p>

	<h4>Ultra FP64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A few years ago, a Twitter account called <a href="https://x.com/ufp64" target="_blank">UltraFP64</a> appeared and a website, <a href="http://www.ultrafp64.com/" target="_blank">www.ultrafpga.com</a>, was created to show off the reverse engineering of the N64 hardware into FPGA form.</p>
	<p>With five years of progress put into this project, author Murray Aickin, aka Mazamar312, stated that UltraFP64 was completed and undergoing updates, though his YouTube channel is oddly quiet and hasn't publicly has seen any new activity regarding UltraFP64 since 2020. Mazamar312's github also doesn't contain any repositories regarding UltraFP64 either.</p>
	<p>What happened to the project? I'm honestly not entirely sure, but an interview that Murray Aickin gave to Cherry Pixel Ninja in June, 2023, is about the last breadcrumb I can find on the matter, and it doesn't reveal too much other than we will be suitably impressed with the progress once it does release. Check the video below from the 38-minute mark.</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sXAmJp1XeA"></iframe></center>
	<p>N64's are finite, Nintendo isn't making anymore, and once they're all dead (hopefully not for a long time in the future), they will be lost to time. FPGA projects like this are essentially hardware emulators, that are reverse engineering the exacting operations of a console and feeding them into a new, fresh, purpose-built body. Much like the MiSTer FPGA projects, but more on that later!</p>
	<p>The majority of Mazmar312's findings are documented on the <a href="https://n64brew.dev/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">N64 Brew Wiki</a> for all to read through use, towards their projects.</p>

	<h4>Ultra Retron</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Hyperkin has a knack for hyping something and said product then disappearing off the face of the earth. This is the story of the Ultra Retron, an N64 clone that debuted in front of real live people at E3 2019, only to vanish into obscurity.</p>
	<p>Luckily for us, Andrew Steel managed to capture a little under 2 minutes of footage of the Ultra Retron while he was at E3. He stated that the product was still heavily beta, but it was enough to turn heads, you be the judge.</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PRbKGuIC_w"></iframe></center>
	<p>Personally, I remember being hyped for this, but then I saw the video, and my hype turned to dispair within 10 seconds of the video rolling. Why you might ask? Because the clip shows <i>Mario Kart 64</i> running nicely, but it's clearly emulated and not emulated well. The jumbotron screen seen above the tunnel in Mario's Raceway is clearly not working as it would on real hardware, so what is it running?</p>
	<p>Most Retron devices run on Android, so this is our first clue: the console isn't a clone at all, it's simply an emulator with a cartridge slot reading the ROM. It was discovered that it was in fact a fork of Mupen64-Next, which (back then) had the exact same issue with the jumbotron regardless of what platform you used the emulator on.</p>
	<p>If it could stuff up Mario Kart 64, a relatively low-level game to emulate, what other issues would the console contain at launch? It is notable that none of the games on display were expansion pak enhanced titles, so I wonder if that was an issue during the development or if the emulator simply couldn't incorporate that feature properly for the demonstration. </p>
	<p>Sadly, the Ultra Retron never saw the light of day, and now, five years on, there is still no word on this device ever coming into existence, especially with competing companies like Analogue having a release date set for their hardware.</p>

	<h4>Warrior 64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Who remembers this one?</p>
	<p>What started as a kickstarter, intecgaming (https://intecgaming.com/) promised HD visuals and a modern twist on Nintendo's 64-bit classic. The problems began when review samples were sent out to various YouTubers and reviewers (sadly not myself), they all unanimously complained about the state of the video output and the disappointing design of the console itself.</p>
	<p>The parent company stated that the products shipped out back then were merely samples and were not indicative of the final product. Though even today that remains the state of the product they sell, even under the guise of "V2" marketing.</p>
	<p>What was on offer were $100 kits to upgrade your existing N64 with a new shell, HDMI output, and a new style mini controller, or for $150 there was a premodded console, complete in the box and ready to play all your favourite games.</p>
	<center>
		<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Features/AlternativeN64s/WAR1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/AlternativeN64s/WAR1.png" width="30%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
	</center>
	<p>The issue was that the consoles overall design was not favourable, and they would be essentially destroying old consoles in order to make new ones. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they purposefully only used consoles with decimated shells, but this most likely wasn't the case. The other elaphant in the room is the HDMI element, and it's marketing, bigging up the feature as if it were a "plug and play" alternative, which was even demonstrated to be on par with more costly UltraHDMI mods, which it really was neither. Soldering was required, and it used a terribly laggy 720p HDMI solution.</p>
	<p>One last issue I have is that they shipped units with a piece of sandpaper, and instructions on how to use the gritty-medium to clean a cartridge's contacts before use.</p>
	<p><b>I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT DO THIS!!</b></p>
	<p>What were they thinking? That took away even more of the Warrior 64's credibility, leaving it with not much kudos out the gate.</p>
	<p>As a piece of obscure N64-related history, it's an obscure piece to own, and the site is even still up today:</p>

	<h4>Honorable Mention: MiSTer/Clones</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>MiSTer hardware, for those who are unaware, acts like whatever console you program it to be. Rather than strictly emulation, the FPGA is a real implementation of the circuits within the target console. This means cycle-accurate recreations of original hardware and far more faithful output for the end user.</p> 
	<p>Recently, an N64 core, made by <a href="https://x.com/AzumFpg" target="_blank">Robert Peip, aka FPGAzumSpass</a>, was made available that has incredible compatibility. So much so that the developer feels that the project has gone as far as it can and halted development until new hardware configurations come along that can enhance MiSTer cores. The current core offers no enhancements over the original N64 hardware other than HDMI output and filters such as clean HDMI and CRT scan-lines, and even outputs at 240p resolution with no ability to upscale.</p>
	<p>Entering into the MiSTer ecosystem is not for the feint of heart, because a decent DE10 Nano set up typically costs upwards of $300 ($235 + $60 RAM and USB-2-N64 connectors like SNAC) and prices have steadily risen to cash in on this new found popularity. Thankfully, there are people out there who intend to disrupt this increasingly lucrative niche, namely <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_" target="_blank">Taki Udon's MiSTer Pi</a>, who set out to forge clone boards for under $100 and RAM modules for under $20 to combat what is effectively price gauging of the Terasic DE10 Nano boards.</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9AyF9iUTd80"></iframe></center>
	<p>The N64 core has incredible levels of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H4KYg0gsOWGayioXKSETtlM7d7g3Tk4w0QXqtXvugG8/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">compatibility</a>, with all games bootable and finishable for the normal and turbo (80Hz) cores, thanks to the latest update's built-in per-ROM patches. You can obtain the N64 core in its updated form by simply running the "Update_All" process on your MiSTer devices.</p>
	<p>You can visualise the incredibly swift compatibility progression below, charting just the first 169 days of the project to run the full USA N64 ROM set:</p>

	</center>
	<p>For those looking to invest but don't want it looking like a piece of circuit board in a clear plastic coffin, it is also now possible to dress your MiSTer Pi up to look like an N64! I couldn't finish the MiSTer section of this article without shoe-horning another niche piece of N64-themed merchandise into it! A special mention must go to this MiSTer Pi case designed by FWWWN, which encapsulates the N64 and 64DD aesthetic, albeit elongated, within the form of the MiSTer Pi hardware. And the STL files are free to download:</p>

	<h4>Sixty Four Futures</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Nintendo 64 continues to be a much beloved console, and as it approaches its 30th anniversary in 2026, I hope that Nintendo will embrace their console lineage and produce something stellar for the N64's big birthday bash.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, the Analogue 3D is the next in line to be scrutinised by fans of the system, and I will be putting it through its paces upon release with every cartridge I can throw at it.</p>
	<p>I may also have to dip into MiSTer Pi at somepoint because the project is just too tempting to someone like me, and after reading about it for this article, im very tempted indeed!</p>
