	<h4>Sticky Business</h4><hr>
	<p>As of August 12th, Hyperkin has released their Hall Effect replacement Joystick Module solution (GameCube Style) for the Nintendo 64. The drop-in module is priced at just $14.99 and takes mere minutes to install, even by those who are not particularly tech savvy.
	<p>Previously, companies such as <a href="https://retro-bit.com/n64-stick/" target="_blank">Retro-Bit</a> have offered similar replacement parts, but to absolutely slaughtering critique from fans, who reported that their product was laggy, imprecise, and overly sensitive.
	<p>I'm a big fan of the Game Cube stick, having used a few controllers with GC style sticks for N64. My thoughts are that as long as the sensitivity and input lag can match or better that of the original, Hyperkin are on to a winner!

	<h4>Magnetic Majesty</h4><hr>
	<p>Installation of the zero-drift part is simple. With just a handful of screws to remove, the drop-in module could not be easier to fit, ready for play in under 5 minutes. The official instruction video can be seen below:

	<p>Initial reactions to the magnetically enhanced parts are positive, with users saying it feels good and the range of movement is near identical to that of the original N64 stick module. The sensitivity seems to be on par with the OG to, allowing you to sneak, run and spin effortlessly in <i>Super Mario 64</i>.
	<p>I would like to get my hands on one and perform a stick diagnostic on Hyperkin's offering to see just how it holds up in terms of range and gate. Watch out in the future for my views on it, if and when I can get one!
	<p>Products like this beg the question: Why aren't Hall Effect sticks the inductry standard yet? Haven't Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft learnt that drift is not a feature; it's a huge and all too frequent issue!
