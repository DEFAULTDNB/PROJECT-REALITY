	<p>Which version of Top Gear Rally 2 did you have? 
	<p>It's not entirely common knowledge, but it has been documented that while America, Japan, and most of Europe saw <i>"Top Gear Rally 2"</i> release in early 2000, the UK alone got the same game under the slightly different title of <i>"TG Rally 2"</i>.
	<p>While the ROM differences are negligible, the game having an alternate title is intriguing because it's so minor, yet the cartridge, box art, and manual all sport this alternate naming.
	<p>I only found out this title had a regional difference because I recently spent two days snap-shotting every ROM and regional variant that I could get hold of, to add to ReCollect64's screenshot repository. Once I had identified and confirmed it (as I said before, it is a known variant, nothing new to document), I spent some time ensuring that my images reflected this finding:

	<h4>Top Gear Really?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Whilst I always blindly assumed I had <i>"Top Gear Rally 2"</i>, beging that I reside in Europe, it turns out that I do in fact own the <i>"TG Rally 2"</i> variant of the game (NUS-NL2X-UKV) along with the Japanese cartridge (NUS-NL2J-JPN). The X in the NUS ID usually represents a bracket of languages within Europe; however, in this case, the ROM language is English only in the EUR version as well as the UKV version.
	<p>As an example, Carmageddon 64 has variants NUS-NCD<b>Y</b>-EUR and NUS-NCD<b>X</b>-EUU, indicating a language split, where EUR typically contains German and French (northern European languages) and EUU usually comprises Spanish and Italian (southern European languages). Both also contain English language too. 
	<p>Interestingly, the <b>X</b> in that example contains Spanish, German, and French for Carmageddon 64, and the <b>Y</b> version has English, French, Italian, and Spanish built-in.
	<p>I feel like there are no hard and fast rules we can follow to be entirely sure without examining the ROM information or simply starting the game to the suitable language menu option. Either way, my mission to own as many variants as possible is more focused, but yet increasingly diverse!
