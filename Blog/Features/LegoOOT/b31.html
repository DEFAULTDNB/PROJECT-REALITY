	<h4>Unofficially Awesome</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Super Brick Dude over on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/888801488357060" target="_blank">Nintendo 64 Facebook group</a> recently posted their latest LEGO project, a map of Hyrule from <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>!</p>
	<p>Needless to say, I'm super impressed with the level of detail that has already gone into this. With just a few key details, you have iconic locations such as Lon Lon Ranch, the Market Square, Hyrule Castle, Lake Hylia, Death Mountain, and even The Great Deku Tree.</p>
	<p>I particularly like the sheer simplicity of the piece, with such a small scale (one dot in most cases), capturing a wonderfully impressionist glance of the world map through bite-sized points of interest. The portcullis and towers of the castle, and the rooftops and windmill of Kakariko Village are all instantly recognisable!</p>
	<p>Super Brick Dude's previous work on <a href="https://rebrickable.com/users/Super%20Brick%20Dude/mocs/" target="_blank">ReBrickable</a> is fantastic, and schematics for this build will be available to purchase once complete.</p>

	<h4>Official Offerings</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I spoke to Super Brick Dude to get some more information, and he told me that essentially these projects take him around a month to devise and build, with a multi-phased process of initial design done through <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page" target="_blank">Stud.io</a>, then breaking it down into the steps required to build it and finally drawing up the PDF instructions, along with the artwork. Finally, he verifies the plans by ordering the parts and building it himself, ensuring the project is ready for others to enjoy!</p>
	<p>At the time of writing, the number of bricks used is 621, and the model sits at approximately 30% complete. Super Brick Dude stated that this 48 x 48 baseplate build will weigh in around the 2000 piece mark depending on the final complexity of the valleys and mountains.</p>
	<p>The final build should take roughly two hours for anyone to complete, and it is estimated, even with SBD being price-conscious, that the cost of parts should be around $200/£150. With the blueprints costing $10/£8 on average, it will be an incredibly rewarding project to take up for anyone willing to construct the entirety of Hyrule!</p>
	<p>I for one will be following the progression and checking out the final build when it's ready because Hyrule, as depicted in OOT, is so wonderfully nostalgic, and it would look fantastic alongside my N64 collection in my garage!

	<p>Sadly, LEGO and Nintendo themselves have not yet offered us anything near these incredibly detailed hommages to the overworld of <i>Zelda</i>; instead, LEGO has recently released the official LEGO Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, which is the first <i>Zelda</i> themed set to be offered by the plastic brick company.</p>
	<p>The $299.99/£259.99 price tag might prove a little tough to swallow, with the average consumer often preferring to pick up small and midrange LEGO kits over larger, more eye-wateringly priced sets. The Great Deku Tree is definitely for the collectors and seasoned fans of the series, rather than casual LEGO enjoyers.</p>
	<p>Will you indulge in the official LEGO set, or will you, like me, await this project's completion, purchase the plans, and head over to Bricklink with the list?</p>
