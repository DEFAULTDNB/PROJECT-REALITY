	<h4>Cut Content Comeback</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/elarix2" target="_blank">Elarix</a> and their team have restored a cut Star Fox 64 game mode where you controlled the Great Fox!</p>
	<center><iframe id="SF64R" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmZl8i-uAng"></iframe></center>
	<p>The original mode known as "Jyuza Modo" was akin to <i>Knife Edge Nose Gunner</i>, with players controlling the Great Fox's turret guns in order to vanquish waves of enemies followed by a final boss. Elarix has managed to re-implement turret mode and has demonstrated a few possible use-cases within Star Fox 64's code where the content was probably cut from.</p>
	<p>Of the 15 locations that make up the game, only one, Area 6: "SB" (also known as the Venom Air Defence Zone), seems to have retained the code for this mode in a stubbed-out beta section of the level. This discovery of this beta content was originally made a few years ago by <a href="https://x.com/punk_7890" target="_blank">Punk_7890</a>, while they were working on their <a href="https://github.com/punk7890/Star-Fox-64-Randomizer" target="_blank">Star Fox 64 randomiser</a> project.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the designation "SB" that refers to the beta content found within Area 6 (one weird worm enemy), relates to Starblade, the 1991 space shooter game by Namco. The original developers of Star Wing were so inspired by Starblade that the mode is a direct hommage and is named "Starblade Imitation" within the code.</p>
	<p>Elarix notes that the layout and spawn position of enemies within Area 6 would corellate to the turret mode, with enemies still situated awkwardly edge of screen in the final mode that would have been easier in turret mode. Though some attacks are entirely unavoidable with this on-rails view and barrel-rolling out the way is a far better option for the final cut of the game.</p>
	<p>The reasoning for the content being cut is simple: it was not finished in time for the final games release which is a shame, however, we are lucky enough to have modders like Elarix and punk_7890 working on restoring cut content for us now! Perhaps one day we will finally get to play as ROB, assisting Fox and co. with the firepower of the Great Fox, in Star Fox 64/Lylat Wars!</p>

	<h4>Decompiled Delights</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Elarix previously demonstrated that there was further cut content, the Venomian Battleship, and within that show reel they also mentioned the fact that the Star Fox 64 decompilation project is all but complete!</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonicdcer/sf64" target="_blank">Star Fox 64 decomp project on github</a> is currently capable of building the starfox64.us.rev1.z64 ROM and is now ready to be taken forward. This means that fans can take advantage of Star Fox 64's raw source code, and ports and modification projects can begin to take place!</p>
	<p>Elarix has already previously uncovered red lasers (that match the E3 1996 development footage), slots for additional levels between Bolse (stage 11) and Sector Y (stage 14), beta textures, and even unused developer voice lines!</p> 
	<p>I would highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Bo1EaPdn3jgDjBLrgnwAw" target="_blank">Elarix's YouTube channel</a> if you're into Star Fox 64 in any way shape or form, because the channel is packed with awesome content!</p>
