				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Features/NoGames/N64Console.png" alt="N64 Stats" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">N64 Game Info</div></div>
				<h4>'The N64 Had No Games'</h4><hr>
				<p>I have heard this a lot throughout the years. People would sound off that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games" target="_blank">SNES had 1,700+ releases</a> and that there were a startling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_(A%E2%80%93L)" target="_blank">4000+ games on Sony's first PlayStation console</a>, but the N64 had "f#&k all." I would typically retort with "What percentage of those SNES/PSX games have you actually played?" and the answer was always very few, perhaps a handful of games, but definitely no where near a significant percentage of the available titles.
				<p>Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Super Nintendo had a lot going for them, particularly RPG games, movie tie-ins, and light guns! During the 90's, they were fierce rivals, with the whole reason the first PlayStation existed being for Sony to spite Nintendo after the sourness of their illfated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_NES_CD-ROM" target="_blank">SNES-CD</a> partnership.
				<p>Rivalry is a good thing in the industry because it nurtures progression, innovation, and most importantly, variety. But back then, obtaining 1000+ games was impossible for most people, and within each console's respective catalogue was undoubtedly a percentage of dud titles. The bigger the catalogue, the higher number of games that small percentage represents.
				<p>With the N64, Nintendo utilised their "seal of quality" to best effect, ensuring endless torrents of sub-quality games didn't show up on their platform and thus the number of games quickly dimished. That, plus Ninetndo 64's cartridge-based approached to distribution as opposed to CD, meant smaller or more optimised games and higher development and manufacture costs. 
				<p>If you wanted your game on a Nintendo, it had to be good! There were even games like Resident Evil 2 that is today deemed the impossible port, because of the incredible amount of optimisation and skill it took to whittle down 2 CD's worth of data (757 MB to be precise) into a tiny 64 MB cart.
				<h4>Disecting the N64 Catalogue</h4><hr>
				<p>As a collector, I like to know how many games it takes to complete my collections, so I recently broke this down and discovered that of the N64's 388 individual titles, within that you have (roughly) 83 Sports titles, 65 Racing, 49 Action, 36 Fighting, 25 Platform, 20 Simulation, 18 Shoot 'em up, 16 Adventure, 16 First-Person Shooter, 14 Puzzle, 14 Board Games, 
				9 Strategy, 8 Party, 3 Card-based, 1 Rhythm, and a couple more miscellaneous ones that slip through an indescript net. I have classed these fairly loosely because there are arguments for and against calling the <i>Zelda</i> games RPGs or action-adventure games, and while both are true, which is really the most accurate categorisation? You could probably cantankerously argue that you're role-playing as Wayne Gretzky, Superman, or even Star Fox in their titular games.
				<p>You could even get more granular and sub-categorise sports games, for example, into ice hockey, soccer, fishing (OOT also had fishing in it), and so on, but for the purposes of keeping it simple and easier to follow, I have kept the genre split to a minimum with games falling into their most approximate categories.
				<p>I wanted to visualise this data and see what proportion of the N64's catalogue made up those categories, so I crafted a crude chart. As you can see below, the N64 was actually a sports-heavy console with racing and action-based games at the forefront, regardless of it being synonymous with some of the best FPS games ever made:
				</p>
				<center><div id="myChart" style="width:95%; max-width:500px; height:500px;overflow: hidden;"></div></center>
				<script>
				google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
				google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
				function drawChart() {
				const data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
				  ['Genre', 'Number'],
				  ['Sports',83],
				  ['Racing',65],
				  ['Action',49],
				  ['Fighting',36],
				  ['Platform',25],
				  ['Simulation',20],
				  ['Shoot em up',18],
				  ['FPS',16],
				  ['Adventure',16],
				  ['Puzzle',14],
				  ['Board game',14],
				  ['Strategy',9],
				  ['Party',8],
				  ['Misc',5]
				]);
				const options = {
				  title:'Genre Breakdown',
				  is3D: true,
				  responsive: true,
				  maintainAspectRatio: true,
				};
				const chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('myChart'));
				chart.draw(data, options);
				}
				</script>
				<h4>Vital Statistics:</h4><hr>
				<p>While the N64 had less than 400 games to its name, of those titles, which ones stood out? Well, though most "top 10s" almost always site adventure and platforming games for the majority, there is notably only one sports title in the feature: <i>Mario Tennis</i>.
				<p>This seems to indicate that though the N64 was saturated with over one fifth of its titles being sports games, they were rarely impactful or console sellers. The N64 has had a reputation for having mainly first-person shooters on it, but the reality is that under 5% of its catalogue is actually comprised of FPS titles, and of those 16 games, 2 of them hold the second and third spots in the N64's all-time top ten on Metacritic, a site that aggregates thousands of reviews per-game.
				<ol>
					<li>The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time <span class="badge score"><i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> 99%</span>

					<li>Mario Tennis <span class="badge score"><i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> 91%</span>
				</ol>
				<p>I think that the majority of the N64's preconceptions spring from the fact it had 4-player support, and as such, experiencing multiplayer FPS games in front of one single TV screen was unheard of in the late 90s. A lot of people have shared memoires of playing the likes of <i>Turok 2, Rage Wars</i>, and even <i>Duke Nukem 64</i> in the luxury of their homes with three mates huddled around a screen. Those days were massively impactful formative memories of a relatively fledgling gaming environment where more than two players competing together was brand new.
				<p>RARE notably stepped up and excelled with the N64 hardware, exclusively bringing us not one but two solid first-person shooter titles that every other console manufacturer at the time would be jealous of, for years to come.
				<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> and its spiritual ancestor, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, are two of the most incredible FPS games ever made, transcending the N64's end of life in 2002 and still being talked about in 2024!</p>

				<h4>False Negatives:</h4><hr>
				<p>With the games listed above still being referenced today, the N64 is perhaps a misunderstood console. It could also stand as one that people possibly missed out on during the late '90s, and as a result they either had a PS1 or held on to their SNES until they eventually graduated to the PS2, DC, and GameCube era.
				<p><i>Ocarina of Time</i> is widely acclaimed as the best game ever made. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was a pivotal release in demonstrating and redefining the analog stick and showing off innovative 3D platforming. <i>GoldenEye 007</i> redefined and pioneered the modern FPS, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> raised the bar 007 set, and is still revered as a masterpiece. I'm not saying that the PS1 didn't have highly rated games; I'm just pointing out the ratio of quality vs quantity that Nintendo's "seal of quality" stood for back then.
				<p>In <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" target="_blank">Metacritic's</a> top-rated games of all time, <i>OOT, GE 007</i>, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> solidly hold three of the top 20 spots, while the nearest PS1 entry sits at number 23 with <i>Tekken 3</i>. Personally, I love the Tekken series of games, so I fully appreciate <i>Tekken 3</i>'s longevity in the charts.
				<p>It's great to see that the N64, a console that purportedly "had no games", still holds its own in 2024.
				<p>Personally, I can recommend a whole slew of games for the system, the majority of which were N64 exclusive up until very recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/NightdiveStudio" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios</a> have done a stellar job in bringing N64 gems, such as the <i>Turok trilogy, Shadow Man</i>, and <i>Doom 64</i>, to the modern consoles. I recently completed all of those on my PS5, and I have to say it was the perfect blend of enhanced graphics, rejuvinated controls, and pure nostalgia; highly recommended!
				<p><i>Diddy Kong Racing, Rocket Robot on Wheels, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Space Station Silicon Valley, Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness</i>, and <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> to begin with are all worthy of your attention, even today.
				<p>(Note: DK64 & Ogre Battle haven't been available since Wii U VC.)</p>

				</span>
				</center>
				<p>None of the above games are available on recent platforms, probably due to licensing restrictions, but regardless, they are N64 exclusives that are still definitely worth a look today.
				<p><a href="blog.html#b3">N64Recomp</a> should pave the way to enjoy these games on PC again, with better framerates and upscaled resolutions. Their style, playability, and originality are through the roof, so I cannot wait to get stuck back in!
				<p>Hopefully this will set the topic to rest, and allow people to enjoy the games they want to, however they want. Emulation, ports and OG hardware are all fine by me!

			<h4>A Ripping Good Time</h4><hr>
			<p>As a collector of variants, I want to know that I'm getting a legit game and that I will have the freedom to dump, preserve, examine, modify, and emulate them should I wish to.
			<p>The JoeyN64 by BennVenn is a device that I have had in my arsenal for a while. It's operation is so simple that all you have to do is connect a USB-C cable to your PC and drag and drop the ROM off of an N64 cartridge to back it up.
			<p>If you want to play your backups in an emulator, or on another flash cart, just dump them in a ROMs folder and away you go. Want to play through <a href="https://www.pj64-emu.com/" target="_blank">Project64</a>? Simply connect the JoeyN64 to your PC, load up PJ64, and select the ROM from the cartridge once the drive pops up. In order to use your saves with the cart, copy them off first and put them in the PJ64 saves folder.
			<p>At the time of writing, the JoeyN64 is $55 AUD (¬£29) from BennVenn's Shopify store, and it is supported by a discord group where the other main feature is a very lively chat: the ability to reflash repro carts!
			<p>Reflashing clone carts means that if you were to be in posession of a Smash Remix cart, you could simply update it at any time by dragging and dropping a more recent version ROM onto the cart, overwriting the previous version. 
			<p>The only issues you may face are those of the CIC regioning, and as such, you must flash a compatible ROM to the installed hardware CIC, or you can try to convert the ROM.
			<p>JoeyN64 main features:
			<ul>
				<li>Fast, easy, reliable access to all your N64 ROM's and Save files - EEPROM (4/16K), Flash (All types), SRAM, Memory Pak.
				<li>Supports reflashing the latest chinese bootleg N64 games. 
				<li>Supports reading/writing save files from these Chinese carts where other N64 cart dumpers cannot. 
				<li>Drag and Drop ROMs to write to the cart.
				<li>Enjoy some of the best ROM hacks and remakes on real hardware! 
				<li>You cannot rewrite original Nintendo carts.
				<li>Can detect if a cart is fake or genuine. (Connect to a smartphone for easy cart identification when you're out hunting for games).
				<li>Supports N64 and Z64 ROM's, can automatically byteswap (Write in mode.txt which file format you prefer).
				<li>Can load directly from cart into Project64 emulator.
				<li>Drag and Drop Firmware updates over USB-C
				<li>New firmware files will be available as we discover new Chinese bootleg types
				<li>~750kbytes/second dump speed, ~310kbytes/second flash speed.
				<li>Official N64 Dev Carts NOT supported without external 12 volt supply modification.
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>Easy to Upgrade, Easy to use!</h4><hr>
			<p>I recently used my JoeyN64 to dump some Taiwanese and Malaysian cartridges, and it took mere seconds to achieve this. Inserting the cartridge, and dragging the ROM off is incredibly intuitive, and it's so quick in comparison to older, less stable methods of dumping with a Game Shark and parallel a port!
			<p>Updating the JoeyN64 to the latest firmware is as simple as plugging it into your PC, dragging across the "mode.txt" file first, and then dragging the "firmware.jr" file afterwards. The "mode.txt" file is editable in several ways, and for flashing an update it must have the word "UPDATE" in the first line. After this you can change the modes as you wish:
			<ul>
				<li>PAK - Access Controller Pak saves (controller port)
				<li>FCE0-FCE4 - erase sectors of the flashcart
				<li>FCE or NOERASE - if the cart cannot be read/written to
				<li>UPDATE - update Firmware
				<li>N64 - Set file format to N64 
				<li>Z64 - Set file format to Z64 (Byteswapped)
				<li>BANK0 - First 64mbytes of MultiCart access (Z64 Format)
				<li>BANK1 - Second 64mbytes of MultiCart access (Z64 format) 
			</ul>
			<p>Changing modes is as easy as editing the txt file, which is simple, but it feels a little clunky, and what if you have it on the wrong mode? Thankfully the JoeyN64 is pretty smart for the most part, and I haven't experienced any issues using mine to dump or reflash repros.
			<p>As alluded to above, there are software CIC commands (softCIC) you can use too, such as "61052" for converting a 6105 ROM to run on a 6102 cartridge. It's by no means foolproof and more often than not, it won't work due to compatibility of the CIC in your repro hardware. Luckily there is a fantastic flashing guide and reference by Gent over on his <a href="https://github.com/TheGent/Gents-N64-xdelta-Patches/blob/main/Gent's%20Joey64%20Clone%20Cart%20-%20CIC%20%26%20Save%20Type%20Guide.md2" target="_blank">github page</a> that untangles softCIC quandries, and <a href="https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/pages/n64-bootleg-carts" target="_blank">BennVenns Bootleg Guide</a> lets you see which repro carts are the most compatible for flashing ROMs to.
			<p>There are <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools.htm" target="_blank">other resources too</a>, such as <a href="http://micro-64.com/database/patches/S-Paladin.zip" target="_blank">Paladin</a> or <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools/obs-mot3.zip" target="_blank">MotetIII</a>, that can convert the CIC and <a href="https://github.com/StarHack/n64reflashing" target="_blank">patch the CRC</a> to run again.
			<p>The ability to copy saves from the cartridge or dump them from the Memory Pak, also opens up the possibility to use modded saves, because not only are they readable, they're writable too!
			<p>An upcoming feature for the firmware includes 900k/sec transfer speed, which is over twice that of the current JoeyN64 MCU speed. This will make dumping and flashing so much quicker than it already is, and I for one will be updating the second it becomes available. Another upcoming piece of software, that BennVenn has hinted at is a GUI for these tools, which will begin with the Joey JR GBA flasher/dumper and will eventually make it to the JoeyN64 someday. This could be incredibly useful and would negate the need to manually edit a txt file each time you want to swap modes.
			<p>The JoeyN64 is a dream come true for verification and backing up ROMs as a collector, but also as a reflashing tool for hobbyists. The one downside to the JoeyN64 is that it cannot dump development carts, the tombstone-like prototype cartridges we see people finding in random places that miraculously contain a fully playable build of <a href="https://n64squid.com/rev-limit-unreleased-n64-game/" target="_blank">Rev Limit</a>, for example.

			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Incredibly easy to use<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Compatible with PJ64 plug-and-play<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Supports multigame flashcarts<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Works on smartphone too</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Prototype carts need a 12v mod to dump</br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Needs a GUI to further enhance usability</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>I'm a huge fan of this device because this is the perfect way to verify, dump, and preserve your own ROMs with zero fuss and minimal effort. You can even drill into the other available features to do a heck of a lot more if you need to. Overall it is effortless to use and well supported through the discord channel, and I cannot wait to see what updates and features come next!

				<div class="bgBanner" style="background: rgba(231,0,18,255)"><img src="Blog/Features/NSOJune24/NSO.png" alt="NSO N64" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">N64 on NSO</div></div>
				<h4>N64 Expansion Pak Line Up:</h4><hr>
				<p>It's a shocking statistic; less than 10% of the N64 catalogue is represented <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-nintendo-switch-online-switch/" target="_blank">officially on Nintendo's NSO online platform</a>. This week <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> join the ranks of replayable games, but how do they fare?
				<p>To date, there are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_Online_games" target="_blank">36 N64 games</a>, out of a possible 388, on Nintendo Switch Online's N64 Expansion Pak service. Japan has <i>Custom Robo</i> and <i>Custom Robo V2</i> as exclusives, while the USA and EUR regions have <i>Dr. Mario, Iggy's Reckin' Balls, Pokemon Puzzle League</i>, and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> as their exclusives. 
				<p>Notably, <i>Sin & Punishment</i>, a Japanese exclusive, has had USA box art added for its English language release that's exclusive to NSO, even though no such physical copy exists other than in bootleg form.
				<p>Nintendo is drip-feeding games across NSO at such a slow rate, that I'm beginning to doubt that the Nintendo Switch will ever see Donkey Kong 64, or Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, as the Wii U did (though there are at least two slots still remaining in the NSO N64 database).
				<p>Licensing issues aside, I feel that Nintendo is trying to get away with doing as little as possible when it comes to truly offering and preserving the games in a way that people can replay them faithfully, as they were intended to be experienced.

				<p>Nintendo is the keeper of the games, and also the ones DMCA'ing anyone who attempts to enjoy games that aren't even on their shaky platform. Why is N64 emulation on NSO so broken, and why is it acceptable for them to leave it in such a state?
				<p>The internal name for the N64 emulator is "Hovercraft" and it is based on the Wii U N64 emulator developed by Nintendo and iQue. It is used as a blanket emulator, in tandem with LUA config files, to operate with every ROM. While the emulator does bring a few features such as JIT real-time code compilation, RPT for texture replacement, and online multiplayer, it also brings a lot of game-breaking bugs thanks to this blanket approach and no game specific optimisations. Rather, they use LUA to bodge the games into running on an all-for-one emulator. 
				<p>How on Earth does this even pass QA??
				<p>Nintendo has seen fit to included suspend points, upped resolutions, and enhanced frame rates to play these games, though all we see is broken or missing effects, performance issues across the catalogue of games, and horrible input lag. That's not to mention a complete lack of a proper remapping function for the Joy-Cons or the N64 controller. The way the buttons are laid out, or worse, the requirement for you to switch configurations on the fly on a Joy-Con, is heartbreaking.</p>

				<h4>New Entries, New Problems</h4><hr>
				<p>It's incredible to think that Nintendo could mess up their own platform for playing games that are otherwise unavailable to play elsewhere (unless you own the carts). Somehow, they have taken a console so beloved by so many, and churned out crappily emulated versions of our favourite games almost every time.
				<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> is something we have dreamed of for a long time, with a solid story mode, cooperative, and now online multiplayer. But yet somehow this version, the version you pay your hard earned money for, is borked upon release.
				<p>For starters, the game chugs in a way that it NEVER did on OG hardware, there are sounds, effects, and textures rendering incorrectly, hiddeous input lag, poor analog controls, and to top it off, the controller bindings are useless: even with the BlueTooth N64 Controller.
				<p><i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> also suffers from heinous input mapping, missing screen effects, and memory Pak pop-ups that should have been patched out at very least. It's a poor showing for a game that revolutionised FPS games in 1997, that it can't be replayed seamlessly in 2024. 
				<p>Looking back at the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> release in January 2023, it was the same story. It still has not been rectified to make the game less janky to play and fix various issues that the N64 never presented. There was one patch released in August 2023 that addressed some texture and framerate issues, though it only served to exacerbate sound quality issues, and still has yet to be fully fixed.
				<p>Fundamentally, the methods deployed are sub-par at their core. Nintendo needs to up their game in the 64-bit emulation stakes, and rather than giving us half-assed emulation, give us guns blazing, cycle accurate playability with the option to enhance frame rates and resolutions, and the ability to correctly display all in-game effects across all games. A little care and attention would go a long way, and they could learn a huge amount from the <a href="blog.html#b3" target="_blank">N64Recomp</a> project!
				<p>Heck, 64DD emulation wouldn't go amiss either. We have known it's existence since the Wii U and 64DD games havn't ever been added to any Nintendo storefront.

			<h4>A Mini Steering Controller</h4><hr>
			<p>I don't know why, but I've wanted one of these for a very long time. I think it's a mixture of morbid curiosity and a penchant for the weird and wonderful in the world of N64 controllers!
			<p>The Performance UltraRacer 64 is unlike anything you've probably seen before, with a singular handle to hold onto and a small foam encircled wheel mounted on the top. The wheel acts as the analog stick twisting left and right to steer, and it houses the four C-buttons at the summit of its form. The remainder of the buttons are sprinkled upon the top of the handle, in thumbs reach, but oddly, even they aren't as they seem. The cluster of blue and green buttons are NOT A or B buttons, instead, they are L/Z/R buttons with a bonus "Extra" green button as the fourth.
			<p>Underneath the handle is not a Z-trigger, it's the A and B buttons but in the form of a strange two-way-trigger; clicking upward for B, and clicking downward for A. This trigger also acts as the up and down analog stick controls. On the right hand side is a switch, and this one turns the A and B buttons on and off, and remaps them to the D-Pad left and right buttons. It's like Performance said, "Take every feature and turn it on its head", because not much on this controller makes sense.
			<p>The D-Pad buttons are just beneath the position of the main wheel, and again, in what I would consider odd order; Up, Down, Left, Right. I perhaps would have positioned them; Left, Up, Down, Right so that the cardinal directions matched up more with the edges of the controller, for ease of use? Towards the bottom of the prong are the Start and Set buttons, the latter of which can be used to programme 14 out of the 16 buttons on the controller, so you could completely remap it if you were so inclined!
			<p>Programming the buttons is simple: hold the Set button until it beeps, tap the button you want to change, followed by the button you want it to become. The pad beeps when beginning and again upon completion to indicate a successful programming. Reverting the pad back to default is achieved by holding A+L+R for several seconds upon turning the console on with it plugged in.
			<p>The wheel, is a very strange creature. It measures 2-inches across and fits nicely between your fingers with its squishy, foam-rubber surround. It turns just 45¬∞ clockwise and 45¬∞ anticlockwise, so it has a tight, responsive feel to it, but, and this is a big but: its responsiveness is questionable.

			<h4>Small Wheel Energy</h4><hr>
			<p>In order to test out this racing-centric controller, I chose the original racers on the console: <i>Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, F-Zero X</i>, and, for good measure, <i>World Driver Championship</i>.
			<p>For <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, <i>F-Zero X</i>, and <i>World Driver Championship</i> the UltraRacer 64 fared well overall. Steering around corners and navigating tracks feels good, but the buttons feel slightly off all around the controller. In any game menus, character or vehicle select, it's recommended to slide the A/B switch off so that you can use the D-Pad left and right buttons as the A and B buttons. Once the game commences you switch the slider back to the on position.
			<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> was pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to control. It was like skating on ice, the turning circle was almost nonexistent, and the characters glided effortlessly out of bounds when attempting to round any corner.
			<p>The biggest issue I had with this controller was the A/B slider/trigger controlling the analog Y-axis. I genuinely don't understand the design choices made to get this pad to function. It's so specific in its design towards racing games that it feels like Performance then tacked the rest of the features they omitted back on, through any bizarre way possible. 
			<p>Overall, the UltraRacer 64 has its merits for driving games specifically, but beyond that, it's purely chock full of gimmicks that sadly won't make this an essential purchase unless you are mad on racing games 24/7.

			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>

			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>The UltraRacer 64 is yet another oddity from the N64 era that now serves as a talking point collectable rather than a controller that you would choose to ever replace your OG trident. It's niche means that you should only reach for it when strictly playing car-based racing games.

				<h4>Recomp Fast, Decomp Slow</h4><hr>
				<p>Mr-Wiseguy's N64Recomp project came to light at the beginning of May, bursting out the gates with a promise of statically recompiling N64 binaries into C code for use on other platforms. With one demonstration provided; <i>The Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask</i> has seen an incredible resurgence in the last 4 weeks, with virtually everyone I know enjoying the game at 60fps, with gyro aiming, in wide/ultrawide screen, and with a rejuvenated analog camera system.
				<p>The way the <i>Majoras Mask</i> port was built using the <a href="https://github.com/rt64/rt64" target="_blank">RT64 graphic renderer</a>, means modern APIs such as Vulkan, can be deployed for maximum compatibility across more platforms and with massive resolutions compared to N64's native 320√ó240, or 640√ó480 with an Expansion Pak.
				<p>Recompilation aims to immediately recompile binaries without the need for lengthy (upwards of years) decompilation beforehand, followed by months of porting to other platforms via their respective SDKs. Some decompilation projects have been running for years, with only <i><a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64" target="_blank">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zeldaret/oot" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Erick194/DOOM64-RE" target="_blank">Doom 64</a>, <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/perfect_dark" target="_blank">Perfect Dark</a></i>, and most recently, <i><a href="https://github.com/pmret/papermario" target="_blank">Paper Mario</a></i> taking the limelight. The problem with decompilation is that to get a perfect one-to-one replica of a game's source code takes a long time because each function, instruction, and opcode needs mapping out and verifying at multiple stages to ensure correctness.
				<p>I have been following the majority of these decompilation projects for a long time, most since inception, but the progress is a long and arduous one, and not one that most game-enjoyers can commit to, even if they REALLY want to see their favourite games get a fancy new up-rezzed PC port. It's usually left to those in the know, but with N64Recomp; it could become very convenient for anyone to run any game.
				<p>By incorporating tools such as Rabbitizer, which is a MIPs decoder that can convert ASM (machine code) to C, ELFIO, TOML11 and FMTLIB, then directly piping it all to RT64; you will have the ability to easily build your own ROMs into playable PC ports in minutes.
				<p>At least, that's the aim, because currently, without Mr-Wiseguy's tools being made public yet, it takes even the most well versed in coding a couple of hours to get their head around the process of linking and building, let alone fixing errors and residual problems, such as game specific microcode, you will undoubtedly face when starting each game from scratch.</p>

				<h4>What's in the Pipeline?</h4><hr>
				<p>With incredible features such as ray tracing and HD texture support coming to the RT64 engine, N64 ports could look like fresh games, and with <i>Banjo Kazooie, Rocket: Robot on Wheels</i>, and <i>Superman 64</i> being immediately worked on by Mr-Wiseguy, the future of N64 gaming is very bright!
				<p>The ability to recompile our own games is a feature I'm massively looking forward to. <i>Wave Race 64, Lylat Wars, Diddy Kong Racing</i>, and <i>Conkers Bad Fur Day</i>, to name but a few! Can you imagine <i>Wave Race 64</i> with Ray Tracing?! There are so many gems in the N64 library that could benefit from just the enhanced framerates and increased resolutions, that I'm extremely excited to get my hands on the toolset when they drop.
				<p>Thankfully, as mentioned before, Mr-Wiseguy is in the process of building tools that can load, translate, and read any N64 ROM for recompilation in next to no time. Extra touches like modern controller mapping, gyro support, increased FPS, and widescreen culling will come as configuration files and executable revisions, because each game needs individual care and attention to port features to offsets, but the overall time reduction, compared to standard decompilation, is astounding. As an example; <i>Majoras Mask</i> was recompiled to a playable state with RT64 upgrades and full console-accurate effects in under 2 days!
				<p>If any of this still sounds like too much work, then rest assured that others will jump at the opportunity to provide the final executables we need to play the games, we will just have to shove a ROM into a directory, the same way the <i>Majoras Mask</i> works right now.
				<p>You may be asking yourself if N64Recomp will make emulators redundant; I don't think so. Emulation is a more universal approach to faithfully, and cycle-accurately, play ROMs, but N64Recomp adds a lot more by way of modernising the games with features that emulators don't currently offer if you have the time and inclination to put into it. Emulators, because of their maturity, are instantly more compatible, and are way more convenient for the end user across a variety of platforms. This may change depending on N64Recomp advancements, but that remains to be seen at the time of writing.
				<p>I do wonder though: can these principals be used to recompile games from other systems, such as 3DS or GameCube? 
				<p>I hope we might find out in the not-so-distant future!

			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/InterActVortex/Vortex.png" alt="Vortex" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">InterAct Vortex</div></div>
			<h4>Far From Plane, Wheely Weird</h4><hr>
			<p>Let me guess; you just looked at the banner image and said to yourself, "What the $&%# is that thing?!". I did too when I first saw the InterAct Vortex controller for N64, but it didn't stop my hunting one down and bagging one, for the insanely low price of just ¬£10!
			<p>The Vortex is an enigma, even to those who know about it. It's half steering wheel, half flight stick, and half controller, making it 150% insane. Starting with the controller aspect, you have to un-dock the controller portion from the mounting bracket via a square metal peg, and once you have just the controller in your hands, you will be quite disgusted at its chunky, unflattering and un-ergonomic form.
			<p>It is quite literally horrible to hold, and to make things worse, its vastness and unwieldy edges make it uncomfortable to grab on to for long periods of time. The button placement is good, and the shoulder buttons are there, but where is the Z-Trigger and the actual analog stick? Well, I'll get to those gripes later. The whole thing feels plasticy, it has squared-off sides, and it's far too burly to grip. It reminds me of the OG Xbox controller, the Duke, it's far too big, but at least the Duke had comfortable curves.
			<p>Connecting it back to its mount you get an idea for its steering pedigree. While the mount has ZERO buttons or functions, the square metal peg pushes into the back of the controller, and the device regains its analog abilities. The switch on the front right controls the analog modes, and you have the option to use it as a wheel or as a flight stick, the latter meaning if you tilt the whole thing towards you or away from you, you will rise or fall, just like a plane's yoke. Back in the 1990s this must have seemed so space-age, but today it's a stark reminder of how NOT to make a hybrid controller, I mean; how many things like this have you seen for modern consoles?</p>

			<h4>It's no Yoke: It's Bad!</h4><hr>
			<p>The Vortex is a jack of all trades but the master of none. Not one. It offers so much and looks fantastically "90s-modern", but it squanders its potential in every direction.
			<p>Using the controller, most games control ok, but you're missing the analog stick and an L/R or Z-trigger depending on what position the switch on the bottom left is set to. Not to worry because the J button acts as a surrogate for whichever button you misplace, but that button is rock solid.
			<p>To give it a varied test I fired up <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i>, <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, and <i>Hexen</i> using the three available setups. <i>Mario Kart 64</i> admittedly controlled well in steering mode, and using the toggle on the top right I could adjust sensitivity on the V-Axis. <i>Knife Edge</i> was a mixed bag, with the sensitivity and inversion throwing me right off, however, in-game you can alter the settings to make it far more controllable and enjoyable.
			<p><i>Hexen</i>, on the other hand, was hilarious to essentially drive around, with flight controls. Pushing forward moves the analog stick forward to walk, while tilting to the left or right turns the protagonist, so for a hot minute it was quite fun! The auto-fire and slow-motion buttons worked fine; however, I found that the "Direction Control Knob", or D-Pad, was very quick to rapidly fire off when even so much as slightly held down in any direction, and I could not seem to turn that off or prevent it from happening.
			<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Vortex also features its very own rumble mechanism, which requires 2xAA batteries inserted into the rear. It has a small switch on the back of the pad to select rumble mode or save mode, though why it can't rumble whilst saving to a memory card in the slot is beyond me. Another swing, and another miss!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Q&A Toadfan5!</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Thank you! I'm always happy to talk about games since they're such an important part of my life.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Lets begin this Q&A by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>So I think a lot of the retro content being created has been focused too much on the NES and SNES, and while those consoles are excellent, I think the N64 has a lot to offer that people just genuinely don't know about. So I'd like to tell people of all the great N64 games that have gone overlooked for too long.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually been playing games since I was about 3 or 4 years old. I found my sister's original Gameboy and played Super Mario Land 2 a Power Rangers game and a Barbie game (I also lost Mario Land 2 by dropping it through some floorboards) My first home console though was the N64 that I got from my grandparents for Christmas in 1998 with Yoshi's Story and NASCAR 99.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My retro collection is most filled with just the games I really like or that seem worth playing. Except for the N64 collection which is the 296 north American releases and around 40 of the Japanese exclusives, and one European exclusive...and one game that went everywhere except north America. Funny enough the console I have the most games for besides the N64 is actually the Xbox 360 which is definitely my second favorite console.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Speaking of favorites yeah of course the N64 is my favorite console. I have such good memories of it throughout so many different parts of my life. To round out my top 5 though I'd have to go Xbox 360, Dreamcast, SNES, and GameCube.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually really been back into GTA 5, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, Donkey Kong 64, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Rock Band 4.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually got an autographed copy of Diddy Kong Racing DS that I won from an old Banjo Kazooie fan site called Roysten's Fishbowl! That and I got a custom Mario themed N64 that I've used practically everyday since 2015.</p></div>				
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The N64 DD. I've wanted one since I heard about it in Nintendo Power back in like 1999. I feel like most of the games are possible to obtain someday (minus Japan Pro Golf Tour 64 and Doshin 2) but I want the actual add on so badly.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>If it gets more people playing more games I'm fine for any of 'em. If I had to pick one game to get the decompilation treatment though it would be Bomberman 64 the Second Attack (easily the most underrated and overlooked N64 game)</p></div>

			<h5 class="subtitle">InterAct Racing Wheel V3 ~ June 8, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/InterActV3Wheel/IV3W.png" alt="V3Wheel" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">InterAct V3 Wheel</div></div>
			<h4>Steering the Conversation</h4><hr>
			<p>I picked this wheel up a few years ago because I intended to craft a small, cheap as chips racing set up in my living room. I wanted to be able to re-play the <i>Top Gear Rally</i> series of games as well as <i>World Driver Championship</i> and of course <i>Mario Kart 64</i>!
			<p>The V3 feels great, even if the wheel feels a little small, though that works to its benefit by feeling tight and compact. The face buttons do a great job of 
			The wheel has two lock switches to configure the wheel in two adjustable ways. The first is the tilt of the wheel, which has two spots: 45 degrees and straight up like a forklift driver. The second lock switch controls the height of the wheel, which is a blindingly good feature to have depending on how you approach using the wheel.
			<p>You can either mount the wheel on a surface via four suction cups, or you can raise the wheel to max and plant it between your thighs like a novelty go-cart!
			The main mechanism is spring-loaded on each side of the wheels axle meaning it feels like it's pulling you back and automatically re-centres itself when you ease off.
			<p>It is possible to completely modify all aspects of this input peripheral thanks to a nifty on-board programmable button. For example, if you hold the "Set" button for two seconds you enter function mode, and from there you can either remap any buttons you like to any other button you like, or you can adjust the sensitivity of the Y-axis steering between 30/90 & 150 degrees. Setting it to 150 degrees means turning the wheel a lot, whereas setting it to just 30 degrees means quicker turning with less effort. For fine tuning, you also have a small red slider on the left of the wheel that can adjust it tighter or looser on-the-fly.
			But if you hate it all and want to reset the wheel you can do so by holding Start+L+R at any point and you're back to default in a jiffy.
			<p>The V3 comes with a set of pedals too, and these are also springloaded. They feel great, they have a nice tension and a satisfying returning action to them that feels great. They plug in to a rather weak looking DIN socket on the rear of the wheel, but both the pedals and the wheel come with 8 feet of cable to give you plenty of room to manoeuvre.</p>

			<h4>Whats the Deal?</h4><hr>
			<p>The first batch of V3 wheels was not compatible with the Rumble pak, but a second batch was produced, and by the end of 1997 everyone was treated to force feedback. Luckily mine rumbles, however if I insert any sort of third-party rumble pack the controller completely stops working, and I have to remove it before it comes back to life. I'm unsure why it does that, and it's rather ironic given the third party nature of the wheel itself, but thems the breaks!
			<p>I'm quite a fan of this wheel because it has so many features and so many comfort settings, but it gets really creaky after a short period of time because of the full plastic construction. The buttons feel great, not spongy at all, and overall it has a nice quality to it that you rarely see from third-party peripherals.
			<p>Would I have paid $79.99/¬£65 for this back in the day? I probably would have if I hadn't been just a child with no income of my own in the 90's. There was zero chance my parents would have sprung for this for me either, as I wasn't into realistic racing games as a kid, and if I hadn't used the wheel, it would have been money down the drain that could have been better spent on another game for the entire family to play!

				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Today I would like to welcome none other than Graslu00 to this weeks ReCollect64 chat Q&A session! So without further adue, let's start by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media:</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm a YouTuber, focused mainly on classic N64 games, GoldenEye and James Bond in general. I like to share my gameplay and also help others with the games I cover or show them the best up-to-date ways to enjoy the classics.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My family got me into gaming and PC's in general - my dad would play on the N64 while giving me an unplugged controller as a kid (who didn't do this) and eventually I got old enough to give it a real go by myself. His favourites on N64 were GoldenEye, Donkey Kong 64 and Star Wars Racer. I've been involved with gaming since I have use of memory. My mom introduced me into PC's and that eventually lead into gaming there as well. It wasn't until the Xbox 360 that I got into online gaming however, Halo 3 was my first Xbox Live title back in January 2008 and that was a life changing moment which starting my online presence.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't exactly collect old games other than keeping the copies I've always had - I did expand a bit on those titles I was interested in and/or complete sets for a few pieces. For N64 and GameCube.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The Nintendo 64 would be my favourite console - it's the one I still use to this day and enjoy the most, but if I had to choose one other than that it'd be the Xbox 360 for the reasons I mentioned earlier.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Outside of my YouTube work which includes playing GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and other Bond titles, I focus on multiplayer games mainly. These days I'm mostly just hopping between Fortnite, Counter-Strike and an indie game called Friends vs Friends - but in general I play a huge variety of titles. Metroid, Tekken, Resident Evil, Zelda... But I'm definitely more of a competitive player, I've had some good competitions, tournaments and leagues on my back by now.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Chocolate.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I own a signed copy of GoldenEye & Perfect Dark by the developers that I've met multiple times in the UK. Always a great experience to meet them and share some time together. The Rareware devs really are down to earth!</p></div>				
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Some day I'd love to get my hands on a beta copy of Perfect Dark & GoldenEye. I know they exist somewhere out there... Maybe one day. A few years ago it'd have been the XBLA remaster of GoldenEye but we finally got that!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to any particular games via N64Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm especially excited about Star Fox 64 recompiled. That game must be a dream to play with native widescreen and high framerates. F-Zero X is another title that I think would be interesting to see on PC.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>You‚Äôre ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what‚Äôs your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Wouldn't really know, I'm quite simple when it comes to pizza toppings! Anything meaty is fine by me though, kebab pizza is probably one of my favourites if I had to choose.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What‚Äôs your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive item I own in my collection (other than my PC lol) is probably the official Golden Gun prop replica, while not exactly a gaming item - it is definitely appreciated by those who played GoldenEye!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Finally: How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Graslu00.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'd have to count... x1 RGB modded N64, x1 UltraHDMI modded N64, x1 Pikachu Edition N64, x2 Black N64, x1 Jungle Green N64, x1 Ice Blue N64, x2 Xbox 360, x1 Xbox 360 Elite

			<h5 class="subtitle">The Freshest Flashcart ~ Jun 04, 2024</h5>

				<h4>Whats New With You?</h4><hr>
				<p>As part of my ongoing N64 collection, I have recently purchased the SummerCart64, created by Mateusz Faderewski (aka Korgeaux), a brand new flashcart that not only plays your N64 ROMs and homebrew, but also plays 64DD ROMs without the need for conversion!</p>
				<p>Krikkz EverDrive 64 X7 has been my go-to for a while now, since I upgraded just after it was released in 2019, and before that I happily used the EverDrive 64 2.5 without issue. SummerCart64 stands on the shoulders of giants and takes multiple strides forward, building on everything that's great about the EverDrive series of carts and adds in features such as native 64DD emulation and heaps of developer forward features.
				<p>It should be noted that the SummerCart64 I bought was from Phemon Mod, meaning the casing is the version sold by Mena. Each store and supplier has their own build quality as it is assembled by a third-party, but the SummerCart64 hardware was designed by Korgeaux, and the N64FlashcartMenu software was developed by Korgeaux and Networkfusion (Robin Jones), as well as multiple other contributors, including Meeq (Christopher Bonhage) and Suprapote!.</p>

				<p>Some people will argue that clones are better value, and easier to get hold of. I have never bothered with knock-off devices because though they get the job done, they always seem to have some form of hiccup when it comes to durabilty and software support. I know plenty of people that have purchased a cheaper clone only to have it fail or quite literally fall to pieces just months down the line. This ¬£120 pre-built model is extremely convenient, though for much less the unit is entirely self-buildable, 3D printable, and flashable!
				<p>The build quality of this Mena built SummerCart64 feels really nice; it uses a sleek plastic finish on its smoky grey exterior that feels wonderful even though it doesn't have the tactile texturing of the OEM carts. The cut-outs for the Micro SD card and the USB-C connector are recessed nicely (note: the SD card slot is miniscule and difficult to remove once inserted), and the hex bolt screws are a nice solid touch to hold it all together.
				<p>The first thing I noticed about the SummerCart64 shell is that there is a somewhat gangly button on the rear that clunks around a bit, it really needed to be spring-loaded, or just less rattly, to push it up even higher in the build-quality stakes buy the assembler, in this case Mena. This button can be configured to change 64DD disks, sending USB packets, or raising N64 interrupts for devs.
				<h4>SummerCart64 Features:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>High N64 ROM compatibility (Morita Shogi 64 & Mario no Photopi hardware not supported yet)
					<li>64DD hardware emulation: loads 64DD disks (+ ROM combo/multi Disk)

					<li>Comprehensive ROM save database (including HomeBrew headers)
					<li>Comprehensive ROM information display<li>Real Time Clock support (CR2032 battery)
					<li>Emulator support (NES, SNES, GB, GBC) ROMs
					<li>Saves: EEPROM 4/16 kbit, SRAM 256/3x256 kbit, FlashRAM/SRAM 1 Mbit
					<li>Auto writeback after ~1s to the Micro SD/USB
					<li>N64 ROM box image support<li>Music playback (MP3)<li>Background image (PNG) support
				</ul>

				<h4>Sleek Hardware with Great Software</h4><hr>
				<p>After formatting your Micro SD card to EXFAT or FAT32, you will need to <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/tag/rolling-release" target="_blank">download the latest sc64menu.n64</a> and copy it to the root to load the OS on your virgin SD card. Using a PC and card reader to drag and drop whatever you want onto the device and make any folders you wish is very simple, though you can also use the sc64deployer app on PC. The only stipulation is that the 64DD IPL files need to be stored in a folder called "menu".
				<p>Selecting N64 and 64DD ROMs is straight forward, select with A and then load with A, however, playing games like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit requires you to do the following:
				Select the N64 cartridge ROM (F-Zero X [J].n64), back out with B (don't load the game with A), select the F-Zero Exp Kit dump (NUD-EFZJ-JPN.ndd), then hit R to load the pair in tandem. While this works fine and only REALLY applies to F-Zero X and Dezaemon 3D, I still feel that there should be a simpler way to do this, it feels a little clunky in its execution.
				<p>At first, for the life of me, I could not get the thing to connect to my PC, so I couldn't set the RTC or update the firmware. I later found out through <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood" target="_blank">@LuigiBlood</a> that there were specific <a href="https://ftdichip.com/drivers/" target="_blank">Windows drivers</a> required to communicate to the device, and this allowed me to flash the update and sync the RTC to my PC with ease. 
				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest" target="_blank">sc64deployer</a> app is for loading ROMs, updating, backing up, and debug terminal access. It's a command-line app and relies on commands to operate, but luckily, the <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/blob/main/docs/00_quick_startup_guide.md" target="_blank">SummerCart64 Documentation</a> covers everything you could possibly need to know. All I needed were the commands: "sc64deployer.exe firmware update sc64-firmware-v2.18.1.bin" and "sc64deployer.exe set rtc" to get me where I wanted to be with the device.

				</span>
				<p>The load speed of ROMs is extremely fast from the SD card, and from my testing: EVERY ROM I threw at it worked perfectly without having to convert a single thing. Games like Morita Shogi 64 and Mario no Photopi are just about the only ones don't work on N64FlashcartMenu yet because they require further individual hardware emulation, but that's the same with any other flashcart out there, including the EverDrive X7. Backing up saves for sharing or modifying also worked brilliantly well and was exceptionally fast!
				<p>As you can see, the SummerCart64 is packed full of features and also includes ROM information with boxart support as well as compatibility for emulators within the N64FlashcartMenu OS. The emulators I used include Neon64 V2 for NES, Sodium64 for SNES, GB64 for GameBoy & GameBoy Color, and TotalSMS for Sega Master System/Game Gear and SG1000 (not currently working)! These emulators worked to a point; the SNES emulator is a little less refined, and there were some layer issues in games like </i>Super Mario All-Stars + World</i> but they played well enough to be enjoyable!</p>
				<p>The SummerCart64 is an incredible device, with blisteringly fast load times, compatibility across all regions for a vast selection of ROMs, plus the ability to play games like F-Zero 64 with the Expansion Kit without the need for the 64DD itself! What's more, the SummerCart64 project is completely open source meaning you will see community improvements, forks, and more, making it truly future-proof.
				<p>Mateusz Faderewski is the creator of SummerCart64's core hardware, firmware, and supporting software, and they have done a truly incredible job here. Bearing in mind that the SC64 began its life as a device for creating homebrew, its an incredibly well rounded package that can do virtually everything!
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy to load up & play<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>64DD emulation is a gamechanger<br>

			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>The SummerCart64 is a superb addition to any N64 set up thanks to its open-source nature and sub ¬£100 price tag if you build it yourself. The plethora of options and modes available make this a superb developer tool and an astonishingly good flashcart to boot!
			<p>With community created menu themes and styles already popping up, such as a vibrant boxart-heavy <a href="https://github.com/ArthCarvalho/n64menu" tagert="_blank">Nintendo Switch Online theme</a>, it certainly gives the EverDrive 64 X7 some stiff competition!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Quest64, or should I call you Brian/Mike?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Mike is fine, over the last few months we've become pretty friendly and it's nice to use a name üôÇ</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Shall we kick-off this Q&A by describing your Questing antics on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't think I really have a thing anymore to be honest. The overall goal is to make Quest 64 more visible on the internet in a memorable way, but the road to getting there is weird. 
				There are days where I focus on jarring people's memories about the Nintendo 64 and the games outside of the normal Goldeneye/Smash Bros/etc...posts you see all the time. 
				Other days it's talking about the retro gaming discourse and what we can do to improve it for everyone. A lot of times it's just Quest 64 memes and me chasing people around social media with pictures of Brian. 
				I like to keep it fresh.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The first system our family owned was an NES, my parents got it for my brother and I when I was 4/5 (early 89). It was an absolute blast and my Mom was super into it as well, 
				so a lot of my gaming memories and favorite games were ones I shared with her. She is the reason I have such a fondness for Bomberman, as Mega Bomberman on the Sega Genesis was a longtime favorite of hers.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have a lot of physical games, though I have been trying to shave my collection down as I get older. There was a point where I probably had between 4000/5000 physical games across all the systems.....
				but as time has passed I've sold/traded some of them to continue building my Nintendo 64 collection (and make more space in my house)</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Absolutely! It's the Nintendo 64! Another system my parents bought for me, and one we shared a bunch of memories with....something I'm trying to keep doing with my kids.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't have a routine for games, though obviously I play Quest 64 quite a bit lol. Most of my game time these days is games my kids want to play, so it's been a lot of ARMS, Animal Crossing, Roblox, Kirby Forgotten Land...and almost always on the Switch. 
				I still play a fair amount of Nintendo 64, but mostly games I didn't grow up with so I can familiarize myself with the entire library more.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My favorite go to snacks are all banana based. I like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, banana pancakes/bread and smoothies....but for traditional garbage food I'm fond of regular Lay's potato chips and Dr. Pepper. Really anything will do though, I'm a food hole.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't really thing there's one thing I hold above everything else. I have a fondness for Densha De Go pocket watches, so that's probably the most unique thing in my collection.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>This one is a moving target for me. There's not one thing I dream about, but when I find out that there's an article I want to read in a hard to find copy of Gamefan magazine or a official N64 soundtrack I've never seen before and isn't online.....
				I tend to get hyper-fixated.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>YES! The amazing people over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP" target="_blank">Quest 64 Speedrun Discord</a> were already working on a traditional decomp of the game, but the new Wiseguy tools are exciting and I hope to see Quest 64 make it's way to PC through a recomp sooner than later!</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>You‚Äôre ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what‚Äôs your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm traditionally a cheese pizza guy, but if forced to pick three more toppings I would probably do onions, sausage and red chili flakes.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What‚Äôs your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive game I every purchased was Super Bowling...I think I paid $250USD for it, but that money came from selling a bunch of Guitar Hero guitars during the pandemic to make space in my basement, so it was close to a wash. 
				The most thrifty thing came recently, I spent $1 at a thrift store on a Code Lyoko OST CD that regularly sells for north of $100. Hopefully I'll be trading that soon though as there are lots of people looking for it and that's not really my thing.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have around 45 consoles but as for games, I have no idea anymore lol. I do have just over 500 N64 games, and the total games across all systems is probably north of 3500-4000. I really should go through and re-catalogue everything but that seems like such a job....especially when I really don't play a lot of them anymore.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Thank you very much for your time and being first in a series of ReCollect64 chats!</p></div>

			<h4>Who Doesn't Love a Bargain?</h4><hr>
			<p>When I saw the QuickShot NitroStick (yes that's what they called it!) for sale recently, at a ridiculously low price of just ¬£5, I jumped at the opportunity to add to my selection of oddball N64 accessories.
			<p>QuickShot made a few accessories in their time and this was perhaps their most specialised piece of input equipment for the N64, specifically having been made for the controlling of aircraft. 
			I dont know if you know this but there are only a handful of "flight-sim" games on the Nintendo 64 including <i>Buck Bumble, Lylat Wars (Star Fox), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, AeroFighters Assault</i> and <i>Pilotwings</i>, so there isn't much to pick from!
			<p>The NitroStick has the Z-Trigger on the rear as you would imagine, the A and B buttons are up on the top of the stick along with a hat-switch that acts as the D-Pad. On your left-hand side are the C-buttons, the L/R triggers in button form and the start/turbo/reset buttons too. 
			Lastly, on the underside resides a switch that converts the input from analog to digital, so if a game requires D-pad input instead of stick input, you're sorted!
			<h4>It's Good, But Not Perfect</h4><hr>
			<p>QuickShot sadly didn't build this thing with games like <i>Lylat Wars</i> in mind, because the pew-pew button is not in the correct pace as you would hope, the Z-Trigger, its on the A button. You cant re-map the buttons either so it feels a little off, but on the other hand games like AeroFighters and even <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> utilise the Z-Trigger for your main guns and it feels superb!
			<p>Handling in-game feels nice, really nice, and the pitch and yaw of this stick really builds the immersion when playing games that best suit this equipment. In actual fact ANY game could theoretically be played with this controller, including <i>Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye,</i> or even <i>Zelda</i> if you REALLY wanted to, but I wouldn't. 
			Barring a couple of these fringe-case flight sims the NitroStick doesn't feel great for RPG/FPS/Platforming play, as the learning curve becomes huge, so stick to the perfectly formed trident-controller for those games!
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Feels great for flight games.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Exceptional precision.</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No remappable buttons.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Limited use for games.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>It's not for everyone, nor is it for every game, but I kind of like Quickshot's quirky stab at a realistic flight stick.

				<h4>Interesting Retro Tech</h4><hr>
				<p>Not only will this site offer information on your favourite console, I also aim to fill your mind-hole with info on a plethora of accessories and interesting related devices too.</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Accessories/iQue A1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

				</span>
				<p>In Y2K China's government imposed a ban on games consoles, so Nintendo had to think outside the box to crack the market. The iQue player is an oddity in that it is a console
				that is built into a controller, and it only plays N64 games that have been paid for and downloaded to the memory card. This system was to combat rampant piracy in China, 
				and it worked up until as recently as 2019, when it was hacked by Normmatt, Marshallh, Stuckpixel, Riley/ROL and SUXXORS.</p>
				<p>The iQue had just 14 games available in its life time, these were:
				<ul>
					<li>Animal Crossing<li>Custom Robo<li>Dr. Mario 64<li>Excitebike 64<li>F-Zero X
					<li>Mario Kart 64<li>Paper Mario<li>Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth<li>Star Fox 64
					<li>Super Mario 64<li>Super Smash Bros.<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<li>Wave Race 64<li>Yoshi's Island
				</ul>
				<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask</i> was meant to be release too, which even featured as a screenshot on the iQues box, but it never happened. Additionally a Traditional Chinese Translated 
				version of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was found ready for release in Taiwan (ROC) but it never happened.</p>
				<h4>A Beautiful Design</h4><hr>
				<p>When I bought mine in 2021 I was elated to have finally got my hands on one of my unicorns (I have a list I'll explain in another post). 
				The console was notably different feeling to an N64 controller, due to the missing middle prong and the more traditional form factor. It was smoother, sleeker heavier, and kind of nice! 
				I booted it up thinking that not a lot would happen, and luckily I had the paired memory card supplied with it. I was buzzing to find not only <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario</i>, but also <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>OOT</i>!.
				<p>The games are all localised in Chinese and so look incredibly different when they boot up, and I find that fascinating to observe!</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				</span>
				<p>The iQue could be the ultimate way to play N64 games, for its simplicity and form factor. Nintendo sound definitely revisit this system-on-a-chip model if they ever make an N64 "classic" because it is ideal 
				for pick up and play and the analog stick feels really nice too! The only caveat is lack of multiplayer without an additional device, but these days Nintendo could implement online instead, HDMI out, and possibly let you use your 
				Bluetooth N64 controllers for the Nintendo switch on it for local multiplayer.
				<p>The 64-bit possibilities are endless!

				<h4>When it comes to N64 gaming, what's your ReCollection?</h4><hr>
				<p>I got my console day one, from Toys R Us, after patiently/impatiently waiting on the "if someone doesn't come collect theirs, you're next in line" list. 
				Without thinking, I bagged a console, <i>Super Mario 64</i>, and a green controller, though why I bought a second pad when SM64 clearly wasn't two-player is an enduring mystery.
				<p>I excitedly phoned my friend that evening and told him to come round ASAP to checkout the 3D graphics. The idea of doing homework was thrown to the wayside that night!
				<p>I have great memories of borrowing <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> off another friend, swapping out <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> for a bit. Turok was one of my first experiences of FPS games, and I loved every blood-soaked second of it!. 
				<p>I was in secondary school when the N64 released, so my friend-group had weekly meet-ups at each other's houses; to share and play whichever games we had purchased. We regularly held 4-8 player tournaments for <i>ISS, Killer Instinct Gold, Lylat Wars, Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye</i> to name but a few. 
				If it was during our lunch breaks: we were guaranteed to be late back to class.
				<p>Almost 30 years on, and I still play these games regularly, and I am now closing in on my attempt to collect a full world set of 388 titles. I have just 11 to go!</p>

				<h4>Why ReCollect64 exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>I found it a minefield to get an app that could let me check off my personal collection, tracking exact versions such as UKV as opposed to EUR or AUS instead of EUU. I have tried to collate as much information as possible into one resource, along with matching images for box art, cart labels, manuals, and accessories. 
				<p>N64 collection apps usually reside as phone apps that don't contain regional variants, every ROM revision, or even correct images to accompany all of them. 
				ReCollect64 aims to change this by bringing images, information, and a full-featured and customisable collection app to any device that has a web browser. 
				<p>N64 will always be my favourite console, and I'm proud to present the next iteration of my passion project, which is now known as ReCollect64! 
				<p>Whether you are reminiscing (recollecting) the nostalgia of the console, or embarking on collecting a specific set (re-collecting): you can use the site to do this and much more! 
				<h4>Why this Blog exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>The ReCollect64 Blog will regularly provide a distinct format with articles centering on the world of N64! 
				<p>Firstly, there will be weekly Q&A chats with prominent faces of the N64 world, giving an easy to read and light-hearted insight into who they are and what they're about!
				I have had a lot of support and plenty of willing victims messaging me to join in with the fun, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I already have more than 10 Q&A chats lined up!				
				<p>Secondly, I will be reviewing games, accessories, and merch relating to the Nintendo 64, both new and old whereever possible. If you have any suggestions or would like me to review something N64 related, my coms are always open (see below).
				<p>Lastly, there will be featured posts that contain news, ReCollect64 site updates, interesting modern developments, or simply reminiscing about the good old days.
				<p>Overall, this is simply a space for sharing neat things, memories and bathing in nostalgia, nothing too heavy. 
				<p>So please bookmark this site, spread the word, and check in from time to time to relax and unwind!
