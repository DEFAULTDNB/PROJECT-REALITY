	<h4>Competitive Edge</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in 1996, the third-party peripheral world was like the wild west; anything goes, and usually some spectacularly whacky controllers came from this primordial soup of inventive juices and new fandangled technology such as multiple triggers and analog sticks.</p>
	<p>Nintendo made the OG N64 pad to flex their 3D, 64-bit-driven muscles, with analog or D-pad control for characters, buttons for cameras, triggers for shooting, bumpers for aiming, and the traditional action buttons crammed in as well. Competition PRO must have thought "why reinvent the wheel when it rolls so well?". Instead, they attempted to improve it.</p>
	<p>In addition to all of the above, the Competition Pro NS 64 by Powerplay adds grippy grooves to the prongs underside, rubbery split triggers, ergonomically relocates the START button, and adds a turbo switch for eight of the main buttons on the pad. They also renamed the D-Pad as the "8-way Superswitch", which was entirely unnecessary, and it severely clatters when you press it, which is slightly off-putting while in-game.</p>
	<p>I have to say that the grippy handles add something to the feel, which isn't terrible, and the placement of the start button, though OCD-inducingly unsymmetrical, is actually easier to reach than on the OG when held in its widest "D-Pad mode". It feels wrong to admit this aloud, but it's surprisingly true!</p>

	<h4>Knobs for Days</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>A, B, Start, Z, and the four C-buttons all have an individual selector knob baked into the controller; each has the option to turn it off, turbo, or auto, meaning you can customise each button on the fly. It's definitely nice to have the option to flip on an auto-fire button here and there, and a button for each is far from the most elegant solution, but considering this was devised in the late 90s, it can be forgiven for how clunky it is.</p>
	<p>The analog stick on this one feels particularly tight, and it feels pretty good overall in <i>Mario Kart 64, GoldenEye 007,</i> and even <i>Wave Race 64</i>. After running the stick tester on it, the benchmark readings were Up: 88, Down: -79, Left: -70, and Right: 80, which means the stick is slightly off kilter on the left side (tight OG sticks should measure +/- 83-85 on each axis). Thankfully, no drift is present on this stick and in-game it doesn't feel off at all.</p>
	<p>Overall the feel of the controller is decent, with the D-Pad placement slightly lower down and the start button off to the left; however, the dual shoulder buttons feel plain wrong. They're two small oblongs as opposed to one meaty L or R button, and the rubbery texture is unnervingly, well, rubbery. The position of these shoulder buttons means you hit the TR or TL buttons (turbo-enabled versions of the standard button) more often than not, which is not ideal sometimes. For example, in GoldenEye 007 you don't want to rapidly unload an entire clip with the silenced PP7, and you definitely do not need to rapid smash the sniper rifle either. Luckily you need to hold the button for it to function in turbo mode, tapping it does not activate the button.</p>
	<p>If the L and R buttons were given knobs too, it would be better, and if they weren't made of rubber it would be exceptional. It's a shame to have a couple of slight misses on an otherwise reasonable third-party controller.</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I recently bagged this one for just £6 on eBay, including postage, which is ridiculously cheap in my opinion. The controller is actually really good for a third-party effigy, and though some weird decisions were made in its creation, it's actually a reasonable controller to use as a daily driver if you don't want to fork out for the OG controllers; however, beware of the crappy shoulder buttons.</p>
