	<h4>Buyer Beware</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When buying online today, there are a number of tricks, dupes, and scams that unscrupulous folks use to swindle legitimate buyers out of their hard-earned cash.</p>
	<p>Approximately one week prior to this post, I joined a Facebook group that specialises in my chosen purchase preference: N64.</p>
	<p>Having scoped out everything I wanted to take a look at, I decided to try my first attempt as a "WTB" (want to buy) post, and as I only need two coloured cartridges to complete my colour cart collection, I figured I would dive right in with "Does anyone have Batman (black cart) or Hydro Thunder (blue cart) available for sale in the UK, thanks!".</p>
	<p>A couple of hours later I get a private message, which should have been my first red flag, though I took it at face value and believed that this person was on their way home and would send me some images of the cart he had. An hour or so later I get sent two images of Hydro Thunder; it looked in decent condition, with the date and my name handwritten on a piece of paper, and the seller was asking for a reasonable amount, not a flag raisingly low amount, but a reasonable amount that I was happy to part with.</p>
	<p>Having got the PayPal details, I proceeded to calculate protection fees into the amount I would send, and after clicking the option to pay "Goods and Services", I proceeded to confirm my delivery address with the seller and was told a tracking number would be supplied ASAP.</p>
	<p>The next day, I messaged the seller, and low and behold, their account no longer exists or they have blocked me, and therefore the sale was a scam. The user had no intention of sending anything, and probably didn't even have the item in question anyway, using stolen images to facilitate the ruse.</p>
	<p>I went to the admin of the group, confirmed the user was scammer, and proceeded to initiate a PayPal refund procedure.</p>
	<P>I got my money back immediately. Happy days!</p>
	<h4>Tips to Avoid Scams</h4><hr>
	<p>I won't name and shame groups or any villains involved as this is simply an information piece and not a witch-hunt, nor should any of this reflect badly on the administrators of said groups, because in all honesty, the admins I spoke with were incredibly responsive and took action towards the matter immediately.</p>
	<p>Scammers are hitting every major online store, Facebook groups and marketplace, Amazon, and even eBay. Here are my top tips to (hopefully) help others to avoid charlatans:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Did they DM you directly? If you posted a WTB and they didn't comment on your post there first, it's usually a sign.
			<li>Is the price ridiculously good? If it seems too good to be true, it usually signals a scam.
			<li>Check their profile; does it look sus? No friends, one picture, recent account creation date.
			<li>Can anyone vouch for them? It's a great way to weed out potential scammers, and get verified members involved.
			<li>Are they looking for a quick sale? Including free postage is a red flag too.
			<li>Ask for images of all angles; ask for a time/datestamp; be fussy and assured of your possible potential purchases.
			<li>Watchout for photoshopped date stamps; if in doubt, ditch the sale!
			<li>Pay goods and services; ensure yourself a refund, it's only +2.9% extra!
			<li>Screenshot the lot: evidence is key when attempting to get your money back.
			<li>Launch a dispute immediately; be sure, be confident with it, you did nothing wrong.
			<li>PayPal, eBay, and Amazon tend to side with buyers 99% of the time, but don't take unnecessary risks.
		</ol>
	<p>Of course, it's not always possible to mitigate all of these things, and a lot of the time trusted members buy and sell in these places successfully; but if you're ever in doubt when buying something directly from someone you don't know, just forget about it, move on, and save yourself some agro.</p>
