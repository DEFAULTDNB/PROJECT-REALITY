	<h4>Chapter Tooie</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When Rare Replay was released on Xbox One back in 2015, I remember feeling a sense of joy and nostalgia that we were finally getting more much-needed classic Rare gaming on our (then) modern consoles. The main events were, undoubtedly, the N64-era games, getting a fresh lease of life and with improved graphics throughout.</p>
	<p>This wasn't the first time that Banjo-Tooie was re-released though; back in 2009 it was given a fresh lick of paint for the Xbox 360, and then again, more recently, it was given some tasty 4K resolution enhancements in 2019 on Microsoft's Xbox One X!</p> 
	<p>Seeing the highly rated sequel to <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> come back to a Nintendo console was always going to be a momentous pleasure for lifelong Nintendo fans, and from October 25th we will get to bask in the adventurous glory of <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, though sadly not at 4K resolutions.</p>
	<p>This ushers in the critically acclaimed platformers introduction to yet another new generation of players since it's initial release on the Nintendo 64 back in good old Y2K!</p>

	<p>As many of you already know, Nintendo's NSO service has been fraught with emulation issues and lacklustre effort put into allowing fans to replay their favourite games faithfully. Banjo-Tooie looks to hopefully be an exception to the rule, with people already trawling through the various regional teaser videos, spotting framerate improvements across sections of the game that traditionally struggled on the OG hardware, such as Canary Mary's rock solid battle in Cloud Cuckoo Land, and during the four player multiplayer mode, which now also includes online functionality!</p>
	<p>Sadly, we know that the Stop 'N' Swop functionality will probably never see the light of day on this Nintendo Switch outing because 4J Studios are not involved, but how great would it have been if it had been somehow re-included via savegame sharing between Banjo-Kazooie</i> and <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, like they did with the 2009 Microsoft re-release on Xbox Live Arcade!</p>

	<p>The Japanese trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTgrfUnXm9U" target="_blank">HERE</a> shows off a couple of alternate aspects of the game, including a look at the online multiplayer, and I have to say it looks really good!</p>

	<p>As mentioned above, there are bound to be improvements in terms of graphic fidelity; however, I don't know why Nintendo is announcing this game as "now in widescreen mode" when the game always had widescreen mode available, thanks to the N64's Expansion Pak.</p>
	<p>Let's not kid ourselves that Nintendo's team of emulation experts have aced this one either; I mean, look at the state of <i>GoldenEye 007's</i> NSO release back in January 2023! I fully expect there to be various incorrect special effects and some musical discrepancies, but being able to play this game on the go legally, without a hooky emulation device to facilitate doing so, is undoubtedly a huge triumph for the system.</p>
	<p>Now if we could just get <i>Conkers Bad Fur Day</i>, <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, and <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> on the hybrid handheld too, even with the typical NSO issues, THAT would be utterly incredible!</p>
	<p>Maybe they're saving them for the Switch 2? Who knows!</p>
