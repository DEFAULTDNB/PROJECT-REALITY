	<h4>Mountain Moguls</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>1080° Snowboarding was released in February of 1998 in Japan, April in the USA, and finally in October for us Europeans. For myself and my friends at the time, we loved everything this game stood for: freedom, adventure, and the extreme sports mantras of living life on the (vertical) edge.</p>
	<p>One of my friends invested in an import copy of this game around March of 1998, and as a result of knowing we had it earlier than anyone else would have it, we played it day and night. Picking up the controller and feeling so exhilaratingly at one with the rider in such a technical way was something we hadn't really experienced much since the release of Wave Race 64 in mid-1997.</p>
	<p>There is a lot to be said for the simplicity of the controls in this game. You use the stick to move, break, and turn, and if you want, that's all you need. Dare to jump? Hit A. Desire to tuck in for speed or soften your landing? Use the Z-trigger. That's all you needed to keep it easy and vibing. The rest comes from identifying the best route to the bottom and getting there first without hitting trees or snagging an organ on a rock.</p>
	<p>I had been wanting to replay this one for a while; I wanted to re-live the same level of freedom and ability to seek out my own fastest routes down the various courses. I wasn't disappointed. Though the flow and snippets of memories as to where shortcuts lay flooded back, I immediately found myself just taking in the view, enjoying the ride, and experiencing snowboarding from the comfort of my own home again.</p>
	<p>I sat there for a good two hours, playing race after race, figuring out where the CPU would fail, where I needed to slide quicker, drop faster, and ride the powder. The learning curve isn't too steep, but the mountains are.</p>

	<h4>Vibe Check</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Back in the day I wasn't much for reading statistics or giving a shit if a rider was goofy-footed or otherwise, and the same is still true today. When I fired up the game, I went into that lodge knowing that Rob Haywood, Ricky Winterburn, Kensuke Kimachi, Asuka Hayami, and Dion Blaster would be waiting for me, chilling out or having a game of pool. The rider I chose wasn't anything to do with speed, strength, recovery, or air time; it was all based on fashion and looks. Tommy Hilfiger and Lamar made sure of that. The coolest-looking board was selected to fit the vibe. Skill would put me in first place.</p>
	<p>I'm not entirely deluded; I know the characters weights and attributes do make a difference, but essentially, you should be able to win with each one regardless. It's like saying that Bowser, DK, and Wario are the fastest in <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, so why bother playing as anyone else?</p>
	<p>The feel of your character is what matters; you need to know how quickly they can pop a little jump over a fallen tree or how sharply they can corner without sliding out. I'd rather have a character who's an all-rounder, someone who can handle moguls, turn on a dime, and can buff over uneven land swiftly with a few taps of the Z-trigger. I don't want to boulder downhill like a freight train, unable to turn or jump in the slightest.</p>
	<p>The music and sound design in this game still slaps. The skating sounds of gliding across ice, the sound of carving into powder, and the rush of air whistling past your ears as you sail down the mountainside are perfectly expressed. The animation of the riders clothes turbulently flapping around as they speed through the environments is also incredibly well observed; leaving trails across the snow and seeing the lens flare flickering between the treetops is utterly encapsulating. This game remains beautiful throughout despite the old-school graphics employed by todays standards.</p>
	<p>The breakcore-jungle esque music really keeps the blood pumping when hurtling downhill, the choice of music was inspired, and even today it sounds great to blast down the trails to.</p>

	<h4>Spin Classes </h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Tricking out in 1080° Snowboarding is entirely unnecessary in any race scenario, but that level of style and skill can bring about legendary levels of trash talking. Pulling a sweet grab or switching stance mid-race is one thing, but landing a 720 or 1080 and going on to win the race gifted you bragging rights for years.</p>
	<p>One thing that doesn't sit well with me is the damage bar. I'm not sure why it exists. If you crash, you're slowed to a halt and have to put in a few seconds recovering, so why penalise you twice? If you crash too much, you're booted off the slopes; it feels like overly tough love.</p>
	<p>Performing the spin tricks is tricky in this game. You simply hold the R button, spin that stick like you hate it, and release. If the announcer goes wild and you spun that little stick around three times, you just got yourself a 1080!</p>
	<p>Luckily, you can practice these moves on the half-pipe. Racking up your highest score for the least wobbly landing and the most unique moves performed per run. The music on that half-pipe is absolute fire too.</p>
	<p>One last note: there are three secret characters (Ice/Gold/Panda Boarder), one unlockable course (Dragon Cave), and one comedically penguin-shaped board to attain. Other than that, there is nothing to collect. 1080 is strictly simulation focussed rather than arcade-like in that respect, compared with <i>Tony Hawk's</i> games for example, and notably there is no four-player mode and no grinding tricks to be seen whatsoever.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Still massively playable today.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Chilled vibes and DNB down hills.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Finding the best lines is all encompassing.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Only two players.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Why the damage bar?!</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>1080° Snowboarding is a testament to how building a simplistic game around a technically sound engine works wonders to keep a game feeling timeless. The replayability of this game is through the roof, but I still question that health bar.</p>
