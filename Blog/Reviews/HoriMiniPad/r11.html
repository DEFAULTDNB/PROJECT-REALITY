	<h4>Trident Tested</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the N64 landed in my hands in 1997, I was blown away by the paradigm shift that was the N64 controller. Having only had a SNES prior to the N64, this was like holding an alien artefact; it was futuristic, and it was exciting to get to grips with.
	<p>Around 2002, Hori decided to have a go at re-engineering the N64's OG trident controller into something more modern. The N64, by all accounts, had been superceeded by the GameCube in 2001 with its evolved controller you could see the N64 DNA oozing out of it, but it was different it was refined and morphed the C-Buttons into stick form. The Playstation 2 had also launched a year earlier (2000) with its highly praised DualShock 2 controller that offered 256 degrees of pressure sensitivity on the face buttons and analog triggers.
	<p>Hori essentially paired back the wacky design of the N64 controller, giving it a smaller, more elegant form, they added a Z-Trigger under each shoulder button and they moved the D-Pad into the centre which signified the importance of that analog stick being ergonomically placed under your left thumb rather than your right.
	<p>The smaller form factor may have been ideal as children, or even for the smaller-handed Japanese market, but now as an adult, in Europe, I feel like its airing on the side of slightly too small. It could have done with a little upscaling to make it more burley, in my honest opinion.</p>

	<h4>Now You're Playing with Power!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I got my Hori Mini Pad very late on. It was only last year that I managed to score one in a bundle with an OG grey console and some games for just £50 plus shipping. For me, it felt like I had finally obtained a unicorn. I'd finally got a chance to gawp at this thing, feel it, judge it, and understand it's place in the "second-party" peripheral market.
	<p>Using an upgraded analog stick, akin to that of the GameCube's, and high-quality buttons and internal parts, Hori had managed to update the N64 controller in such a user-sensitive manner, that it feels perfectly engineered and naturally flows with the N64 hardware.
	<p>The Hori mini Pad is a fantastic peripheral; technically, it's better than the original pad, but personally, I still think that the OG N64 controller is the king of it's era for platform games. Perhaps it's the fact that Super Mario 64 was built around this pad, or perhaps it's just the nostalgic feel of the trident while throwing baby penguins off Cool, Cool Mountain, IDK.
	<p>It has to be said that I absolutely love this controller for everything else, especially first-person shooters. I put a lot of time into replaying <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, <i>GoldFinger 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye X</i> a few months ago, and I honestly couldn't rate this pad enough for those games!

	<p>I wish I had one of these back in the N64's heyday! I'm a huge fan of this controller, especially with genres like FPS and racing.
	<p><i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i> feel superb with Hori's Mini Pad, and overall it's a really solid licensed peripheral that is worth every penny, if you can find one!</p>
