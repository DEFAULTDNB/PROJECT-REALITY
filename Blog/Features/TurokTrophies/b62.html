	<h4>Prehistoric Pop-ables</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If I told you that a game from 1999 had fifty unlockable trophies, would you believe me? Well, not a lot of people seem to remember this factoid, but <i>Turok Rage Wars</i> by Acclaim Studios Austin contained a whole heap of achievements to unlock back before trophy hunting became a mainstream pursuit.</p>
	<p>Prior to being named "Rage Wars", this Turok title was named "Bloodlust" throughout its production phases and only took on the name "Rage Wars" towards the end of development to better satiate ratings boards. Modes included in the game have the names "Bloodlust" and "Team Bloodlust" as a nod to the original name.</p>
	<p>IGN reported on the progress of Rage Wars in May 1999, stating that on top of Expansion Pak support, 16 weapons, 16 characters, deathmatch bots, improved framerates, and 36 arenas, it would include:</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>A trophy system which gives players awards for accomplishing certain tasks. These awards can then be saved and compared with friends. The idea is to build character history.</p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
	</div>
	<p>Turok Rage Wars actually featured 50 medals, 36 of which are awarded for completing each level in the game, 10 are reserved for hitting specific critera and the final four are awarded for defeating bosses (Bastille, Syra, Symbiont, Tal'Set). Most of the level-based medals required a minimum of two players and had to be attained twice to unlock them.</p>
	<p>The critera-based trophies are the most interesting because they require you to get 15 frags in 5 mins, 25 frags in 10 minutes, snipe 10 people, avoid death in a round, or kill yourself, for example. These are the first examples of a system whereby you wanted to replay the game to collect accolades. Prior to this, very few N64 games had any form of checklist-trophy system built in, instead using tasks in-game as the checklist but offering nothing extra to boast about.</p>

	<h4>Turok Trivia</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Did you know that <i>Turok Rage Wars</i> featured a game breaking bug that meant it couldn't be completed? The original V1.0 USA release was on a black cartridge, which could be mailed back to Acclaim to be swapped with the V1.1 (Rev A) edition grey cartridge. The price of the grey cartridge has escalated in recent years as it is the rarer of the two, with prices hitting the heights of $970 during 2021 and settling back to around $600 as of today. Prior to this spike in awareness, the cart was worth around $150-180.</p>
	<p>Did you also know that "Turok" is not the character's name? The designation "Turok" means "Son of Stone" and the first "Turok" was Tal'Set, of the fictional Saquin Native American Tribe. To become a "Turok" is to have the "Light Burden" handed down to them, and therefore to become a guardian of time.</p>
	<p>Turok Dinosaur Hunter was originally conceptualised as a third-person shooter, akin to <i>Tomb Raider</i>, but was reworked to take advantage of the N64's hardware. The console's controller was far better suited to first-person shooting than third-person navigation, so the iconic control scheme was devised to use the C-buttons as a second D-Pad to control movement, and the analogue stick would control looking around.</p>
	<p>Tal'Set was the titular Turok in <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Turok Evolution</i>, while Joseph Fireseed (The Coyote Knight) was the Turok in <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i>, while Joseph Fireseed and Danielle Fireseed took over the mantle in <i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i>. All three are siblings, with Danielle being the oldest, and Joseph being the youngest. Danielle was notably the first female Turok in history.</p>
	<p>The cover art for <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> features Joshua Fireseed in hand-to-hand combat with a Velociraptor, which is interesting in that neither appeared in the game on which the artwork resides. Tal'Sel was the Turok in <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i>, and the "raptor" in the game was in fact a Utahraptor, depicted with a horn on its nose and brown striped skin, as opposed to green. It wasn't until Turok 2 that actual Velociraptors and Joshua Fireseed actually faced off. The reason for this is that the artwork featuring Joshua Fireseed tested better with focus groups, so the more relatable and youthful artwork was used instead of the more senior character, Tal'Set.</p>
	<p><i>Turok Rage Wars</i> was developed after <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> as an improved multiplayer experience. Due to this timeline, Joseph and Daniel Fireseed do not feature in the game in any way, as their first appearances in the Turok Comics by Acclaim Comics (and the subsequent <i>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</i> game) were in the year 2000. Though <i>Turok: Shadow of Oblivion</i> ended with a clear setup for a fourth game, it was never made; instead, a prequel was made with Tal'Set as the main protagonist again in <i>Turok: Evolution</i>. Had the fourth game been made, Adon was meant to be a playable character, responsible for resurrecting Joshua Fireseed.</p>
	<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</i> was planned to crossover with <i>Shadowman</i>, but due to poor sales, the crossover was cut out and the levels recycled into the River of Souls, and enemies recycled into the Deadkin who hail from Deadside.</p>
