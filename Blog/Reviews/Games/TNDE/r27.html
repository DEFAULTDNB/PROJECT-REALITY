	<h4>Insanity and Genius</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>Tomorrow Never Dies 64 Expanded</i>, by TiJayFLY & others, is a ROM hack for <i>GoldenEye 007</i> that lets you continue your Pierce Brosnan, James Bond, addiction through a massive 13-level romp based on the 1997 movie.</p>
	<p>The levels include Bazaar, Party, Labs, Press, Hotel, Parkhaus, Wreck, Tower, Saigon, Stealth Boat, Bridge (A View to a Kill), Volcano (You Only Live Twice), Alaska (Metal Gear Solid), and the aptly named level "The End: Hamburg Hub" which encompasses a meet-the-characters showcase and shooting range! The latest version of the patch, version 11-24 (or November 2024), features more custom props, fixes, and higher-quality gun sound effects.</p>
	<p>The first thing I noted about playing this mod, is that some of the levels feel long, but quite sparse in places. Some levels resemble simple corridor shooters, like <i>Doom</i>, where you run through a maze with one path and just one or two spare rooms off the side here and there to explore. Other levels are far more grand, voluminous spaces, but with little going on. Some levels take a couple of minutes to complete; others a mere handful of seconds.</p>
	<p>The disparity between the two styles means that some levels feel like they're only pushing plotline beats for the purpose of storytelling, but ultimately, opening two doors and running to the end does not make for a gripping level. The last thing was that the difficulty is pretty tough, even on the lowest setting, if you don't figure out how to complete objectives you can quickly get overcome by guards. Fortunately, it comes with a <a href="http://n64vault.wdfiles.com/local--files/ge-campaigns%3Atomorrow-never-dies-64/TND64Expanded-StrategyGuide.pdf" target="_blank">strategy guide PDF</a> to hold your hand.</p>

	<p>I'm not going to lie, some of this mod is captivating and great, but other levels feel like filler to extend your playtime, which is a shame. Some examples of the best levels are Hotel, Parkhaus, and Volcano because they express the most interesting geometry to navigate or have the most engaging objectives. Levels like Bazaar, Wreck, Tower, Siagon Streets, Labs, Party, and Press all sell themselves short in one way or another by having nothing particularly interesting to do and nothing visually stimulating to see. Sure, the Mig model looks incredible, but it doesn't feel like a "Bazaar"; it's a stack of crates and a penned-in computer.</p>
	<p>Hotel resonated with me because it was clever; you had to find the hostages, rescue them, obtain the key to the main suite, take out a mini-boss, and escape from the hotel via the roof. Proper tasks! Parkhaus is simple; it is essentially a very standard multistory car park, but it was a great, frantic run-from-cover-to-cover jaunt, which I found invigorating to blast through. Volcano has classic GE007 Aztec vibes. It has more complicated objectives, but it is exhilarating to have that overarching time pressure throughout.</p>

	<h4>Developed a Certain Attachment</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The weapons in this game are varied and sound incredible. You have the watch laser, MP5, MP5A2, Glock 17, PPK, Calico M950, Norinco Type 56-1, star knives (throwing stars), P99, Uzi 9mm, FN P90, Remington Model 17 & the Striker (shotguns), MBA Gyrojet Carbine, Law 80 (rocket launcher), FAMAS, Desert Eagle, and a golden Gyrojet, to name but a few. Each has its own tweaked fire rate and thumping gunfire sounds. Several of the sub-machine guns can fire off an entire clip within seconds, so you need to watch that ammo counter. The Gyrojet's are particularly punchy and powerful, shooting through walls and crates with ease, and the FN P90 is an absolute blast to wield.</p>
	<p>Gadget-wise, we have a small selection of relevant gadgets, but nothing too taxing. There's a fingerprint scanner, the camera, an encoder (that I don't recall using), and just two instances of detonating remote mines.</p>
	<p>To be fair on the project, the movie itself didn't even feature that many interesting gadgets. Understandably the developers didn't want to throw their own in to detract from following the film's exact format and styling, but it might have been interesting to throw something else into the mix. By the end of the game, you discover that they did add some interesting extra elements in post-game, not least by was of the Alaska level from none other than Metal Gear Solid. It's a strange addition, but incredibly fun to see nonetheless!</p>

	<h4>Let's Stay Under Cover</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I noticed the use of several assets from <i>Perfect Dark</i>, such as doors, sofas, and plants from DataDyne HQ, the shelves of alcohol from Carrington Villa, and even Shigeru's head appears a few times! There are plenty of custom textures, objects, and characters in here too, including Carvers face on TV's and banners, Carver himself, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Richard Stamper, Zorin's Blimp, motorbikes (which we couldn't ride), and of course the Mig and the Hind D, and every level has a custom floorplan. The reuse of <i>GoldenEye 007</i> assets are brilliantly repurposed too, with Facility's laboratory tables and glassware, and the textures from Frigate appearing in Stealth Boat, which gives it an instantly recognisable marine environment.</p>
	<p>The face of Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is also notably much more detailed and much more in line with the movie. Other characters' faces and outfits are also better defined, more true to the movie, and more realistic than I would expect from the standard look for NPC's in OG <i>GoldenEye 007</i>. Impressive stuff!</p>
	<p>The music in this game is also fantastic. From the pause screen music to the environmental thrum, there is a nice movie-quality pulse to the entire soundtrack. The team behind it (DavisSimMusic, JJ MH (Ghost), Clasiku, QueenAllTheWay & Shiftclick) have really pulled out all the stops to audibly round off the experience.</p>
	<p>Some bugs I encountered meant that some levels were unfinishable unless you reset them, whereas failing an objective should automatically finish the level and display the "failed" status. For example, on Party, once you get whisked away for the "phone call", if you don't follow the henchmen into the room, the door locks behind them, and you cannot get in to complete the remaining objectives. Another odd glitch occurred on the Bridge level, where the final guard didn't spawn sometimes, but luckily his rocket launcher was still placed on the floor where he should have been, ready for you to explode Max Zorin's Zeppelin.</p>
	<p>If you want to play this mod, then use the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> U Z64 ROM with an MD5 of 70C525880240C1E838B8B1BE35666C3B as a base. Apply the TND64_Expanded_11-24 xDelta patch using the ROM patcher site, and it will result in the final file having the MD5: 1EE22DD1D70443F5E4766D4238756949. <i>Tomorrow Never Dies 64 Expanded</i> runs great on real hardware as well as via emulation, but again, please remember that it is a <i>GoldenEye 007</i> mod rather than a <i>Perfect Dark</i> mod, so save type will need to be set to EEPROM 4k (if you have issues saving). And yes, it supports the Expansion Pak!</p>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Great selection of weapons and SFX.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Too many simplistic "escape" levels.</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Immersion breaking bugs.</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Feels overly sparse in places.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>While the project that TJ Mortimer and friends have put together is technically great, it simply doesn't offer enough objective or visual engagement across the included levels, some are leagues better than others. I hope the developers continue to iron out and tweak everything, because it's an impressive project!</p>
