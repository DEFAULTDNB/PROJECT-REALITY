	<h4>What's Old is New Again</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>RetroAchievements bring you modern achievements/trophies to pop on your favourite retro games through an API framework called RCheevos. I recognise "Cheevos" from building Raspberry Pi related retro consoles using <a href="https://www.recalbox.com/" target="_blank">RecalBox</a> and <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">RetroPie</a> as a base. Cheevos came along after a couple of years and ushered in an era of achievement hunting for games that never had them before.</p>
	<p>This latest iteration brings many more consoles into the fray, including PSP, GameCube, PlayStation 1 & 2, and most importantly, N64! Through emulator front ends such as <a href="https://retroachievements.org/download.php" target="_blank">Bizhawk and RetroArch</a> and dedicated emulators such as <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" target="_blank">PCSX2 (QT version)</a>, <a href="https://www.duckstation.org/" target="_blank">DuckStation</a>, or <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/" target="_blank">Dolphin (2407-68 or higher)</a>, you know have an integrated, universal method of obtaining trophies and Retro Points on almost any retro gaming setup you can build or buy.</p>
	<p>Drilling down into the N64 integration, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/download.php#bizhawk" target="_blank">BizHawk</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/download.php#rap64" target="_blank">RAP64</a>, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/download.php#ralibretro" target="_blank">RALibRetro</a> or <a href="https://retroachievements.org/download.php#retroarch" target="_blank">RetroArch</a> can be used to play N64 ROMs and gather achievements for the 64-bit system, and currently 386 N64 titles are supported, which sounds like the majority of the 388 available are covered, however, this takes into account subsets for games that have multiplayer, hidden modes, and ROM hacks for the most popular games. Many obscure games don't have RA integration yet, but handily, there are tools supplied for developers to use to address this, such as the Achievement Editor.</p>
	<p>Achievement Editor is a quick and powerful way to monitor values of in-game items and inventory, so, for example, if you collect X amount of Y while maintaining X amount of speed; you can pop a trophy commemorating that very specific increment-based success!</p>

	<h4>Stating the Obvious</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The use of emulators to achieve... achievements... means that you obviously cannot get them on real hardware, but, there is a Retro Points system for obtaining them without the use of save states or cheats. This system allows you to play the games as the developers intended, though emulated, and at least you can brag and compare your kudos point collection with others on the RA forums!</p>
	<p>The games that support achievements generally have extremely obvious conditions to meet in order to trigger those little endorphin rushes. For example, in <i>Conkers Bad Fur Day</i>, you must vanquish the Big Mighty Poo to get the "Bowel Movement" achievement; in <i>Wave Race 64</i>, you must unlock reverse mode to attain the "Typhoon" trophy; or in <i>Quest 64</i>, you must obtain level 24 in Earth magic to learn Avalanche and pop "Dropping Rocks." Generally you will hit 99% of these just by playing the titles through fully, but it's also nice to see niche, fringe case requirements too, such as "The Glass Door Trick" in GoldenEye 007, whereby you must complete the mission without killing Jaws, or in Mortal Kombat 4, performing all 4 finishing moves for any character in a single Arcade Tower mode bags you "Kompletality".</p>

	<p>RetroAchievements also logs a heck of a lot of data in order to give you a statistical breakdown of how rare an achievement is, how many people have played the game, and how many people have gained each achievement. The RA team have then generated leaderboards based on who has the most achievements per game and who has the most Retro Points for playing the game faithfully (without cheats and save states, etc).</p>
	<p>Overall, RetroAchievements is a game changer for emulation enthusiasts. It seemlessly brings modern trophy hunting to each nostalgic game, and if you don't see your favourite retro title, give it time as it will no doubt be supported in the future!</p>
