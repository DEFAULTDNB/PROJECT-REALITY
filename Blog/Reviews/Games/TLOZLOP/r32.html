	<p>In a parallel universe where Hyrule doesn’t exist, Zelda is kidnapped by Ganon in her own castle. It is up for our hero, Link, to find all the Golden Skulltula Tokens and save the princess!</p>
	<p>This first demo of The Legend of Peach contains one full level to play.</p>
	<p>In that level, you can experience a new, made from scratch, custom boss!</p>
	<p>PS: The title screen is unchanged as of now. Also, there are some chests and heart pieces not normally obtainable in the ROM Hack. Those are meant to be accessed once you get more items in other levels. However, nothing is stopping you from using glitches or speedrun strats to get those.</p>
	<p>Special thanks to: NicoTap, Skawo, Psi-Hate, PurpleHato, Zel, Noka, Grandlovania for helping out with the project!</p>

	<p><i>The Legend of Peach</i> is a ROM hack for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> by Melonspeedruns that transports Link into Peach's castle. By importing assets from Super Mario World 64 into The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, you get a wonderfully familiar yet alternate version of the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
	<p>Just one level exists for the game, plus the castle and the surrounding grounds. Entering the level involves jumping through the painting al a <i>Super Mario 64</i>, but every surface is given a fresh lick of Hyrule-specific paint. Bob-omb Battlefield has been given the mash-up treatment, with Deku Scrubs taking over where the little Bob-ombs would be and massive "Mad Deku" baddies where the Chain Chomp and King Bob-omb would be; the latter is an awesome mini-boss fight.</p>
	<p>Instead of stars, the concept here is to collect Gold Skulltulas to open the locked doors of the castle. I love this adjusted mechanic; it means you're hunting collectables, instead of completing tasks. It also means that you don't have to go back in and out of the painting repeatedly to achieve a full tally of items.</p>
	<p>Instead of the balance beam, there's a boulder to bomb out of the way, instead of giant metal balls knocking you back down the mountain, it's balled-up Gorons. It's a brilliantly creative remix of the two games, and in my opinion, it works tremendously well.</p>

	<h4>Charismatic Crossover</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Just imagine Wet Dry World with the Iron Boots, Tick Tock Clock with the Hookshot, or Rainbow Ride with Hover Boots. The possibilities this creates are incredible, but also quite complex to switch up for Link's medieval weaponry versus Mario's acrobatics.</p>
	<p>There is so much scope with how to remake all of SM64's 15 levels within the style of OOT because there are cohesive themes that are easily transferable. Such as aquatic levels including Zora, lava flooded worlds featuring Gorons, and any sand-based environments playing host to the Gerudo.</p>
	<p>It would also have been great to have renditions of <i>Super Mario 64</i>'s soundtrack reworked with the instruments used in <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. Such an exciting wealth of options!</p>

	<h4>Cancel Culture</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Unbelievably, this project was cancelled in 2020. The overall complexity of the project combined with various development challenges ultimately led to the demise of the project. Hopefully someone will pick this up again in the future because it is a genuinely exciting concept.</p>
	<p>If you wish to give it a go for yourself, then grab a copy of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 1.00 (U) *.Z64 ROM with the MD5 5BD1FE107BF8106B2AB6650ABECD54D6, and apply the *.BPS patch to it on Marc Robledo's ROM Patcher site. The resulting file should have an MD5 of DF1ACA0E6B5EE6E2EA5F9766FA367FF9.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Incredible crossover.<br>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>MelonSpeedruns and their crew were onto something massive here, but it's such a shame that this has been discontinued.</p>
	<p>A full game built to this quality would have been absolutely killer, but this demo and the genius ideas it contains are massively worth a play!</p>
