	<h4>Quick Cameo</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Do you recollect any of the N64's televised marketing? Do you remember any adverts for the games that got you hyped out of your mind to buy the next title?</p>
	<p>The North American market had some pretty wild and frankly nightmare-inducing adverts that really pushed the envelope in haunting your thoughts and dreams. One in particular, the Banjo-Kazooie campfire advertisement that ran for all of half a minute between TV shows in 1998, mustered up some of the strangest scare tactics I've ever witnessed to make youngsters buy games.</p>
	<p>Recently the creepy, AnimatedFX-made, bird animatronic that was used for just two seconds of screen time sold at auction in December 2024, fetching a cool $2100 on the one-of-a-kind art, antiques & luxury goods auction site <a href="https://www.liveauctioneers.com/price-result/nintendo-commercial-banjo-kazooie-flying-bird-puppet-tvmovie-props/" target="_blank">Liveauctioneers.com</a>. The auctioneers had estimated before the sale that the item should fetch between $300 and $500 (USD).</p>
	<p>Below is the 29-second advertisement that the animatronic features in; the timestamp to see Kazooie is around the 12-second mark.</p>

	<h4>Bearly Any Bird</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Considering that the prop was used for a fraction of a second, it managed to fetch a reasonable amount that wouldn't have broken the bank for true Banjo-Kazooie fans. In fact, I'm surprised that it didn't fetch more considering its rarity and niche value as a piece of memorabilia that the majority of the world wouldn't recall seeing.</p>
	<p>$2100 is quite the bargain, and now that the piece is known to exist, I predict that future sales (should the seller wish to part with it) will see the Breegulls price increase exponentially.</p>
	<p>The detailing, while immense, is spine-chilling, as the creature stands a whopping 34 inches tall with a 42-inch wingspan. I'm glad that the gigantic "realistic" Banjo bear puppet wasn't located too; because I don't think I would ever sleep again.</p>
	<p>Take a look at the intense puppet below and let me know what you think. Would you allow this terrifying rendition of Kazooie to sit in your house? What if the eyes moved by themselves?</p>
