	<h4>Ok Doomer</h4><hr>
	<p>Yes, you are reading this correctly! Thanks to the homebrew SDK/Operating System for Dreamcast, <i>Doom 64</i> is being ported and is now in the early stages of becoming playable on Sega's last home console, by JNMartin84 (of <a href="https://github.com/jnmartin84/OpenLara" target="_blank">OpenLara N64 port</a> fame in 2022).
	<p>Doom 64 originally launched for the N64 in 1997 and saw ports to modern consoles and PC back in 2020. As of July 16, 2024, you can now boot the beloved Nintendo 64 version on your homebrew enabled DC, experiencing the early stages of one of the highest critically acclaimed variants of <i>Doom</i> ever to grace a console.
	<p>There is work to be done, such as adding in enemies, audio and fixing the HUD and clipping, but the concept is sound and the stability of the port looks superb, and you can even try it out if you want to!
	<p>There are a few steps required to get Doom 64 working on the swirly console, but it's fairly straightforward once you have the KallistiOS (KOS) environment set up. Firstly, you need to obtain and use a <i>Doom64.z64</i> ROM with the MD5: B67748B64A2CC7EFD2F3AD4504561E0E, put the ROM in the WADTOOL directory, and then run the script to build the *.ELF and generate the required *.WAD files. Finally, you need to build a self-bootable CD or load from a HDD, ODE, or SD card, using your preferred method.
	<p>Full instructions are linked below on JNMartin84's Github and shouldn't take more than 15 minutes from start to finish. The results are basic for now, but incredibly smooth nonetheless, take a look:

	<h4>What is KallistiOS?</h4><hr>
	<p>KallistiOS (spearheaded by <a href="https://github.com/gyrovorbis" target="_blank">Falco Girgis, aka Gyrovorbis</a> and his team) is a pseudo-operating system for Dreamcast that allows for RAM upgrades, HDD, Lightgun, SD Card Reader support, Broadband Adaptor support, custom BIOS flashing, and in it's most recent updates,KOS now supports virtual filesystems amongst other things. Built on GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) toolchain, KallistiOS is capable of utilising libraries from C++ to Lua, SDL, and OpenGL/OpenAL to deliver a modern, programmer-friendly, developer environment.
	<p>Recently, <i>Sonic Mania</i> was ported to DC using KallistiOS, and demonstrated network streamed assets working with app-level code ported to the system by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonicFreak94" target="_blank">Michael Fadely, aka SonicFreak94</a>, with an impressive 60 FPS locked performance!
	<p>The future of DC homebrew and ports is incredibly bright, and hopefully more decompiled N64 projects will make their way across for more people to play!
