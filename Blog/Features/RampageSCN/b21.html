	<h4>Digging the Dutch</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When it comes to finding artwork for ReCollect64's art repository, I like to search far and wide for images of the more obscure stuff. As a result of my fastidious digging, I quite often bookmark a variety of sites and stores that stock N64 games in foreign lands, and occasionally there are usable images that I can capture to catalogue games visually for all to see.</p>	<p>While hunting for images of a couple of obscure European language box-backs, I noticed something strange, a game with the regional designation SCN which stands for Scandinavian but somehow it wasn't on my radar.
	<p>Almost daily I check eBay and independent game stores to find new European game variants; I have a system, search terms, and lists that I use to track games I want to look into. Several years ago I completed my full PAL 243 game cartridge collection, but as recently as May, 2024, I cleaned and boxed up every game I own to store away in my newly fitted out garage, re-cataloguing odd versions and variants as I went.</p>
	<p>I was in the middle of looking for FAH (French/Holland) and EUU (European Union) versions, when I glanced upon something that initially didn't sound right in my head, so I looked deeper.</p>
	<p>Having worked on ReCollect64 (formerly Project Reality) for almost two years now, I know 99% of the lists like the back of my hand, especially the ones with 20 or fewer games within them. So when I spotted a SCN version of <i>Rampage World Tour</i> on a Dutch shopfront, I was a little bit excited!</p>

	<h4>Striking Gold</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Upon finding this variant, I wanted to properly validate it, and though I had photographic evidence, I wanted to know that I wasn't re-treading old ground and getting hyped over something already known. The best way I could think of to validate the find, was to consult any and every source that had catalogged N64 cartridge ID's and their variants.</p>
	<p>I hit up <a href="https://www.nintendo64ever.com/Search.html" target="_blank">N64ever</a>, <a href="http://micro-64.com/database/masterlist.shtml" target="_blank">Micro-64</a>, <a href="https://niwanetwork.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_64_games_by_serial_code" target="_blank">N Wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.nesworld.com/article.php?system=n64&data=n64releaselist" target="_blank">NESWorld</a>, only to find no results! This was a great feeling, as I may have finally managed to contribute something new to the N64 preservation scene!</p>
	<p>I have collected a few SCN region games on my travels, and I had been working against a list of 18 titles, but now that we know there are 19, I'm definitely going to add this one to my collection ASAP! My current SCN collection consists of just seven of the known variants, you can see the full set below:</p>

	<p>Notably, the game itself doesn't command a higher price, nor does it seem particularly hard to obtain. A quick Google will find a couple of results, and some easily purchasable for roughly the same price as the regular EUR versions.</p>
	<h4>Can Lightning Striking Twice?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As an optimist, I would say yes, there has to be more variants out there that have gone unnoticed, or have been overlooked. There simply has to be, given the number of regions Nintendo saw fit to divide the world into in the late 90s. I think it's more than possible that Asia (ASI/ASM/ROC), Germany (NOE/FRG), or even Scandinavia (SCN/HOL) saw more releases than have been catalogued previously.</p>
	<p>I remember reading about an odd Spanish backed USA version of <i><a href="Backs/ALTU/Buck Bumble ALTU.png" target="_blank">Buck Bumble</a></i>, which led me to a similar USA version of <i><a href="Backs/ALTU/Fighters Destiny ALTU.png" target="_blank">Fighters Destiny</a></i>, which in turn led to finding a Spanish-backed USA copy of <i><a href="Backs/ALTU/S.C.A.R.S. ALTU.png" target="_blank">S.C.A.R.S.</a></i>, it's certainly an addictive hobby!</p>
	<p>Will I be the one to find another variant? I hope so, because until every entry on ReCollect64 has cart/box/manual/accessories/guides and any other underlays or operation guides in their entirety, I will not stop searching.</p>
	<p>If you or anyone you know has any strange versions of N64 games (non-repro, non-homebrew) in cartridge form or boxed, please do not hesitate to contribute to the site by giving me a quick DM and having the ability to take a nice photo of the item at hand!</p>
