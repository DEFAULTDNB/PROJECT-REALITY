	<h4>Built to Brawl</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Sliding into January 2025, we are kicking off our review section with a review requested by several followers: the Brawler64 controller!</p>
	<p>When it comes to N64 controllers, there have been so many shapes and forms that buying the correct controller for you can be a confusing space to negotiate. Do you need one for fighting games, racing games, flight sims, or all of the above? The Brawler64 answers some of those questions with a short sharp, 2017-flavoured, kick up the 1996 console's butt.</p>
	<p>As the name implies, it's a controller built for fighting. Retro fighters decided in their infinite wisdom to channel as much modern energy as humanly possible into a controller for the N64. My biggest question is: Does it rival the <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#r11" target="_blank">Hori Mini Pad</a> in terms of comfort and usability?</p>
	<p>The first thing you notice about the Brawler64 is the distinct lack of the trident aesthetic; it's long gone. Instead, you have the more common two-pronged style of modern controllers, just one analogue stick on the upper left, D-Pad lower left, the start/turbo/clear buttons in the middle, and the six face buttons on the right. To the rear, you'll find a Z-trigger on each side and L and R shoulder bumpers located on their respective sides, and a memory/rumble socket to enhance your games.</p>

	<h4>Ready to Rumble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This controller feels ace, with its sleek physique and super lightweight design. It feels superb in hand and really carries itself well in terms of comfort and ergonomics. The stick feels great, but when benchmarked, you can see that the ranges are completely out of whack, hitting -98 to 111 as opposed to the OG's -85 to 83 for comparison. This means that the stick pushes way too far in every direction, and it feels overly sensitive. The face buttons are tactile and clicky, without too much travel; however, and this is another big one, the triggers are spongy and feel completely wrong.</p>
	<p>Analogue feeling squashable triggers on an I/O digital button make zero sense whatsoever, they should have left that aspect alone rather than trying to add something unnecessary. They should have instead added something of greater use, like built-in rumble, in my opinion anyway.</p>
	<p>To put things in perspective, this is the wired Brawler64 V1 from 2017, not to be confused with the Brawler V2 (2018) which addressed the trigger qualms by making them feel more akin to the original OEM controller, and giving the analogue stick a more OG range and feel too.</p>
	<p>When it comes to gaming on the Brawler64, I think it feels quite good overall. It definitely adds a more modern feel to FPS games; it's great in fighting games like <i>Super Smash Bros</i> and <i>Fighter Destiny 2</i>, and it is also very good for racing games. The biggest thing for me is the stick is less grippy, and it has a constant feeling of being too flighty when sniping in <i>GoldenEye</i> or <i>Perfect Dark</i>, for example. The needlessly spongy triggers compound this feeling, so to seasoned N64 players, it all feels slightly out of kilter, because it fundamentally is!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Supremely comfortable<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Turbo and slowmo functions<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Great button placement</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Poor analogue benchmark<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Spongy triggers</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Having only paid £16 for this one, the wired Brawler64 V1 is a nice controller in general, but it lacks finesse in many areas that will deter serious buyers. Thankfully, Retro Fighters saw fit to revise their products according to feedback, and the V2 sounds like a far more worthwhile product to own, so my advice is to skip the V1 for now. I'll still be sticking with my Hori Mini Pad!</p>
