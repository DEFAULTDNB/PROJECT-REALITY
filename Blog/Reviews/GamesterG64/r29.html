	<h4>Dynamic Driving</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Gamester G64 Dynamic Wheel for the Nintendo 64 is another wheel I picked up recently for absolute peanuts. Just £5.49 + shipping got me the wheel, the pedals, and an unwavering confidence that I could actually win something in <i>World Driver Championship</i>, a game I am painfully bad at.</p>
	<p>The wheel is nice overall, with buttons on the front, buttons on the rear, including one two-way paddle shifter on the right-hand side, and everything you could possibly need to press nicely within touching distance of your digits.</p>
	<p>Plugging the wheel in, you'll need to configure it for some games;others it works straight off the bat. I couldn't find much information on this wheel, even through scouring archive.org's magazine rack. I happened upon information such as the original price point being £59.99, Nintendo Official Magazine singing its praises every issue in the peripherals pages, and I eventually found N64 Magazine issue 25, which featured a mini review that also contained zero information about programming it.</p>
	<p>It's not all bad. At least basic games work with it out the box, like <i>Mario Kart 64, Rush, Rush 2, Rush 2049, Top Gear Rally, TG2, and TG Overdrive</i>. You can also plug in a memory pak to save your games, and there is a small switch next to the socket, to turn the rumble effect on and off, should you wish to.</p>
	<p>The top left button on the wheel, though unlabelled, is actually the A button, so if you get in a bind, you can always hold that down to accelerate in 99.9% of all N64 racing games, wether it is "supported" by the pedals or not.</p>

	<h4>Ready to Rumble</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The G64 comes complete with a rumble motor built in, which is nice, and the wheel performs decently with all of the games I tried it with. I would have loved to have the instructions for programming the damned thing stamped on the underside or something, because it's extremely frustrating not being able to use it to its fullest.</p>
	<p>The other issue I have with this wheel, is the level of creakiness it has within its unforgiving, brutalist, plastic construction. It's not super comfy, but it's not terrible, but the noise, my god, the noise.</p>
	<p>Every button groans, and every time you turn the wheel, it feels like you're doing excessively-violent chiropractor stuff on a severely brittle skeleton. I thought I had snapped it several times during play. My nerves were shot by the end of it.</p>
	<p>As wheels go, this one is serviceable, but I would have liked to see a little more smoothness and comfort, if I had shelled out £59.99 for it back in the day. Luckily I paid just £12 delivered!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Rumble built-in<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Programmable pedals<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Heaps of buttons</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Creaky build quality<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No instructions for the pedals</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>This is essentially another run-of-the-mill wheel from Gamester. It's not bad, but it's not great. Sure, it is functional, and it does work fine, but it constantly feels like it is going to crumble in your mitts.</p>
	<p>I just wish I had the instructions to go with it, they could have stamped it somewhere on it! I may give it a second opinion if anyone can help me out with that; until then it is very much a middle-of-the-road device. No pun intended.</p>
