	<h4>Worthy Winners</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With my personal favourites, <i>Coin Rush</i> and <i>Space Waves</i>, coming in first and second, they really deserved the top spots for offering incredibly well-designed games that are virtually studio standard in terms of features and originality that have been presented in such a charming and playable way.</p>
	<p>Hydra Harmonics is also a brilliantly deserving winner of the third spot, with its innovative and musical cooperative lizard-based gameplay!</p>
	<p>Congratulations to all who entered; you really showed a plethora of incredible ideas and demonstrated just what is possible on the system in 2025! Thank you to everyone who donated and voted towards this Game Jam. With your help, over $1753 was raised, with the first-place winners, HailToDodongo, donating their winnings to the charities of their choice later this week!</p>
	<p>I cannot wait to see if any of these games get updated or continued, and I definitely cannot wait to see what the next Game Jam entails!</p>
