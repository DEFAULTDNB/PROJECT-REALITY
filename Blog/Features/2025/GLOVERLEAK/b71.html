	<p>On January 16th, 2025, Piko Interactive rather playfully tweeted something on their social media account that informed their followers that certain files had been leaked from their servers.</p>
	<p>The source code for their Steam PC remaster of Glover has indeed been leaked online, plus the PSX and N64 code for Glover 1 and 2, and much more besides.</p>

	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone leaked the glover 1+2 n64 &amp; Glover remaster PC source without permission.<br><br>Go crazy checking it out! There will be more official source code release on <a href="https://t.co/yT052BY0BL">https://t.co/yT052BY0BL</a>.<br><br>For now, don’t forget to preorder Rage of The Dragons Neo at <a href="https://t.co/3PGI5cL5Tj">https://t.co/3PGI5cL5Tj</a> <a href="https://t.co/blnpeavCCS">pic.twitter.com/blnpeavCCS</a></p>&mdash; PIKO (@Pikointeractive) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pikointeractive/status/1879887353432690842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 	</center>
	<p>The files, which weigh in at just 1.6 GB in total, are reported to contain full backups from 1998, 2000, and 2018, as well as full assets such as sound effects, textures, models, concept art, packaging examples, and even a "making of" WMV video and "celebratory photos" from the original games creators.</p>
	<p>Each backup contains information from each stage of development, as well as tools, debug information, and documents pertaining to the creation methods used to build the game. There are also files containing notes about cheats and even features and wishlists, all of which offer a fascinating insight into the development of the unreleased sequel.</p>
	<p>Interestingly, the files are also said to contain references and backups for "ODD BALLS", "CRAZY", and "Whack'n'Roll", all of which were the working titles for Glover along the way while ATeam was developing them for the 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The backups contain at least 15 ROMs from varying stages of completeness, spanning the development period, within the files. Two of the NGVE (Glover 2) ROM files, one named "Glover2a.n64" from May 1999 which is a notably early beta, and the other "GLOVER2.n64" comes from a little later on in October 1999, hash identically to the known U region "Proto 1" and "Proto 2" ROMs that had already been dumped and circulated in the past.</p>

	<p>Exactly how these files came to be leaked remains a mystery, and Piko Interactive will no doubt address these leaks further in the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p>Until then, the files that are circulating could be used to quickly further recompilation projects, as the full source for the N64 ROMs is now out there for the taking.</p>
