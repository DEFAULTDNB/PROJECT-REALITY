	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>On Friday the 13th of December, <a href="https://x.com/AKIClub64" target="_blank">AKI Club</a>, AKA S.K. Stylez, over on Twitter, released their V1.1 update patch for the N64 wrestling title <i>WWF WrestleMania 2000</i>.</p>
	<p>The patch, which contains an incredible amount of quality of life fixes, has been distributed as an xDelta file that needs to be applied to the "WWF WrestleMania 2000 (U).z64" ROM which has an MD5 of D9030CA30E4D1AF805ACCE1BFED988CC. The patch weighs in at just 15.9kb and combines fixes and features for edit mode, create a belt, Road to WrestleMania, King of the Ring, Pay Per View, Royal Rumble, modification of individual wrestlers and tag team names and rope colours, as well as fixing audio issues and providing general in-game improvements.</p>
	<p>Prior to this 1.1 update patch, it was only possible to add and adjust "Computer Intelligence" by way of a Gameshark code, but now the developers have added that in as an option without needing to use any cheats or devices to access it. This option dictates how characters will wrestle, determining which moves they will pull next and how they react both inside and outside of the ring based on health, spirit, and in-match randomisation.</p>
	<p>Here are the features listed below:</p>

	<h4>Boosted Brawling</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With the torrent of quality-of-life changes, the game is now closer to how the original THQ developers intended, thanks to the hard work of AKI Club. It's amazing to think that dedicated fans are putting in the hard yards to fix everything from typos to textures and adding back in incredible features like computer intelligence and alternative fighting styles.</p>
	<p>As mentioned by AKI Club, there are no new movesets added, nor any new wrestlers, as this is purely a patch for fixing existing issues and improving what is already contained within the ROM. It's worth pointing out that the updated name changes, and the addition of the Ho, will not show up unless you are using a brand new save.</p>
	<p>Aki Club has also been spotted backporting features from <i>WWF No Mercy</i> into <i>WWF WrestleMania 2000</i> in order to bolster the game with things like additional user-friendly modifications for arenas and more. This should make for some excellent additions to the grappling game that is considered the best in the series on N64!</p>
	<p>If you have any issues with the patch or need help modifying things using the given RAM addresses, then please contact AKI Club directly or visit the thread <a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vpw2dojo/tag-team-entrance-addresses-t296.html" target="_blank">here</a> for further information on the subject.</p>
