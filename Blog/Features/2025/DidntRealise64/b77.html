	<h4>Virtual Insanity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently I have been talking a lot with people from various console scenes about games they loved growing up, and what systems they owned. It came as somewhat of a surprise, that several people I spoke to did not realise that certain games also came out for the N64, and I think I have figured out the reasons why.</p>
	<p>When the N64 was released in 1996 in Japan, many people I know, myself included, owned an original PlayStation after the Super NES started to look dated in comparison. We shifted to 3D gaming as far back as 1994 in Japanese regions, swapping the 2D sprites of 1990's <i>Super Mario World</i> for the 3D delights of Ridge Racer (1994), Tekken (1994), or Battle Arena Toshinden (1995). The transition from 2D to 3D was a paradigm shift, but where was Nintendo's answer to Sony's 32-bit system? The answer was the Virtual Boy.</p>
	<p>Yes, believe it or not, the headache-inducing red and black laser-powered headset was the device Nintendo backed in 1995, but several factors prevented it from becoming a success. Firstly, it wasn't portable like the Game Boy, or it's spiritual predecessor, the View-Master 3D. You physically had to set the thing up on a desk, on a stand, with an eyeshade around the edges to seal you in with the virtual technology. Secondly, and most obviously, it only displayed one colour, red. Nintendo had taken what was so simple about the Game Boy's greyscale screen and shook it up by adding in the only primary colour anyone cared about at the time. In the process, they made a completely unsociable device that alienated a lot of players, so much so that the Virtual Boy was discontinued just six months later in Japan, in December 1995, after it had only just launched there in July.</p>
	<p>Nintendo's focus would become the N64. Deploying 64-bit architecture to combat the current 32-bit climate of the Sony PlayStation, Panasonic 3DO, and the Sega Saturn, all of which released in 1994.</p>
	<p>Skipping that generation of TV-connected consoles caused the N64 to essentially become a place where 32-bit developers wanted to showcase their creations on better hardware. The result was several games synonymous with the PlayStation getting an N64 port. The reason quite a few people don't know because they simply didn't invest in the 64-bit system.</p>

	<h4>A Fast and Two Furious</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The first selection of games that many people had no clue about, were <i>Fighting Force 64</i>, <i>Nightmare Creatures</i>, and <i>Wipeout 64</i>. A brawler, a horror game and a racer; these three games casually alluded many gamers. I recall having <i>Nightmare Creatures</i> and <i>Wipeout</i> on the PS1, and enjoying them a lot. I specifically liked the pumping soundtrack of <i>Wipeout</i>.</p>
	<p><i>Wipeout 64</i> was a game many thought wouldn't happen due to music licensing and Sony owning Psygnosis. The N64 version featured more tracks and vehicles and the use of an analogue stick to control it but suffered from less than silky-smooth framerates and longer than desirable loading times. The loading times were purposefully added to allow decompression of the music files from the cartridge's limited storage space. <i>Wipeout 64</i> scored well in reviews, even against <i>F-Zero X</i>, and was the first and only Wipeout game to feature on a Nintendo console.</p> 
	<p><i>Nightmare Creatures</i> is a gothic-horror survival game about smashing up monsters in eerie-foggy 1830s London. The game was released on PlayStation a year earlier, but the N64 version had FMV removed due to cartridge size limitations. The N64 version notably had a higher resolution and none of the signature PS texture-warping.</p>
	<p><i>Fighting Force 64</i> is an interesting game, but strangely, least of all because it was released on the N64 as well. Originally the game was presented as a 3D <i>Streets of Rage</i> title "Streets of Rage 4". The game was pitched by Eidos, to SEGA, but the blue-hedgehog-wielding team had their own plans for the <i>Streets of Rage</i> series, so Eidos made it theirs, and ran with the beat'em up genre staples of fighting waves of enemies, using background objects as weapons, and end-of-stage boss fights. The game nearly didn't see the light of day at all on the N64. It was actually cancelled by Eidos at the last minute, but Crave Entertainment swooped in, and <i>Fighting Force 64</i> eventually released in 1999!</p>

	<h4>Cannon Fodder</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Interestingly, three more games that flew under the radar are all military-based. <i>Battlezone Rise of the Black Dogs, Command and Conquer</i>, and <i>Nuclear Strike 64</i> were also pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/daily_vinci642" target="_blank">Rem64</a> as games that people easily forget were available on the Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p><i>Battlezone: ROTBD</i> was harshly critiqued against its 1998 PC counterpart and notably called out as a "poor port". The entire game was rebuilt and assets were heavily modified so that it could run on the N64, so it was far from a lazy port. It featured the exclusive campaign "Rise of the Black Dogs", though it failed to make a splash due to the game's frame rate, Expansion Pak requirement, and lack of in-game speech, though today it has been heralded as one of the most technically advanced games on the system in the year 2000.</p>
	<p>The Command and Conquer port, led by Looking Glass Studios, also suffered at the hands of cartridge limitations. All the FMV that made the 1998 PlayStation classic so endearing had to be cut out in favour of static screens and scrolling text, so that it would fit. It also featured no multiplayer mode, which was the final nail in the coffin for anyone considering the purchase in 1999.</p>
	<p><i>Nuclear Strike 64</i> was another game that not many people could name as appearing on the 64-bit system. The strategy/action/simulation game itself is perfectly serviceable, though it was noted that you could just hold down the fire button throughout to win. Personally, I wouldn't have picked up this game because though games like <i>Desert Strike</i> (1992) and </i>Jungle Strike</i> (1993) were fun when I played on SNES and Mega Drive, I found them quite repetitive and fatigue sets in quite quickly.</p>

	<h4>Last But Not Least</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Other games that didn't make much impact generally are <i>Asteroids Hyper 64</i>, an arcade port that didn't really flex the 64-bit muscles of the console; <i>Monopoly</i>, an uninspiring port of the classic game, though it did feature house rules, which was praised by critics; and <i>S.C.A.R.S.</i>, an animal-themed racing game with a twist; its all simulated in virtual reality and based in the year 3000.</p>
	<p>S.C.A.R.S. also notably reviewed well, with critics praising its replayability, but <i>Asteroids Hyper 64</i>, though a faithful arcade port with improved resolution and polygonal models across the 90 levels, goes largely unknown because it was based on a then "retro" game (1979), and retro gaming in the late 90s wasn't nearly as much of a thing as it is nowadays. regardless, these were games that neither sold the system nor excelled in setting their particular genres ablaze on the Nintendo 64.</p>
	<p>Depressing sidenote: <i>Asteroids</i> (1979) was 20 years old when <i>Asteroids Hyper 64</i> (1999) came out for the N64, but <i>Asteroids Hyper 64</i> will itself be 36 years old in December, 2025, making the original it was based on 56 years old this year! FEEL OLD YET?</p>
	<p>Another factor in these games not being widely known about stems from their USA regional exclusivity. <i>Battlezone: ROTBD, Nuclear Strike 64, Nightmare Creatures, Monopoly</i> and <i>Asteroids Hyper 64</i> never saw a PAL release, so those games can be forgiven for being lesser known this side of the pond, though the others did come out in PAL territories and were probably overlooked due to them all being beaten to market by their PlayStation counterparts, and with more features, albeit at lower resolutions and with wobbly textures.</p>
	<p>Was it because almost all the games listed here feature explosions on their cover art? Is that more than just a coincidence? I'll take my tinfoil hat off now...</p>
	<p>What do you think? What games did you not realise were on the Nintendo 64? Why do you think certain games slipped through the net, even though they were critically praised?</p>
