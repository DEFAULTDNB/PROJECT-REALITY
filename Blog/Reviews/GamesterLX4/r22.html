	<h4>Basic Batch</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently I went on a bit of a spree, purchasing several wheels for review, though sadly, not all arrived in one piece. The first Gamester LX4 Wheel I ordered for £16 shipped came shattered, the wheel had snapped off in transit, not good! After a swift refund and a gander for another of the same product, I managed to bag this Gamester LX4 steering wheel for £18, and it arrived unscathed!</p>
	<p>The LX4 is an unostentatious styled wheel with absolutely zero frill factor included. When it was released in the late '90s, it cost around £55, came with spring-loaded pedals, and didn't require any batteries to provide a force feedback rumble effect.</p>
	<p>With a slot at the front to insert your memory Pak, the LX4 was, at best, a budget-friendly option for people to scoop up if they were into racing games. However, even glancing at the wheel, you'll notice it has very little pzazz, and zero consideration for comfort included.</p>
	<p>Plugging the wheel in, I found that it was reasonably responsive, but the spring-loaded wheel was far too stiff to prevent the wheel from skating around off your lap or off the table you're perched on. The buttons also feel very squeaky and basic.</p>

	<h4>Middle of the Road</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As a wheel, this is as plastic-feeling as it comes. It has one paddle on the right to change gears and L and R buttons hidden on the rear of the wheel, as well as having the other buttons on the face of the wheel.</p>
	<p>Testing out <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, the wheel was quite serviceable, but everything feels so stiff that any smoothness you would hope to experience has been completely hammered out during production. This thing feels mass-produced, the grip on the rear is so generic and tactless that it makes you hold on like you're trying to pick up a wet newspaper.</p>
	<p>Playing <i>World Driver Championship</i> was another story altogether. I wanted so much to adjust its tilt down a little or to raise the wheels column up, but it can't. It doesn't have any form of adjustability built in, which means it persistently feels naff. It feels like a shitty go-kart wheel; it's overly light-weight plastic construction and mottled texturing are so bland it's borderline offensive.</p>
	<p>It's not to say that this is a bad wheel; it's simply not an interesting peripheral in general. There is a destinct lack of design flair, no interesting ideas have been applied to it, and therefore nothing to really write home about. Perhaps that's a good thing, not having bizarre ideas or shapes moulded into the thing, but it leaves it entirely devoid of character and soul.</p>

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The Gamester LX4 steering wheel is a total "plain Jane" when it comes to being a peripheral. There are no endearing features, and no wow factor or lustre within it's design and implementation. Its a wheel; it steers, but suffice to say that it won't be anywhere near my top spot when it comes to recommending wheels on the N64.</p>
