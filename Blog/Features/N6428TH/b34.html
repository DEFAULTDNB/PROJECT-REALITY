	<h4>Aging Gracefully</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>On September 29, 2024, the Nintendo 64 turned 28 years old in the Americas! When it launched in Japan on June 23rd 1996, the console only had a small selection of three games available; Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64, and Saiky≈ç Habu Sh≈çgi. In the USA, the console was released with just two: Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64, which by today's standards is a pretty small launch line-up.</p>
	<p>The N64 won't achieve its 28th year of release in the EUR regions until March 1st, 2025. This was because of the delayed launch in Europe back in 1997. The console also cost ¬£249.99 in the UK, whereas in the USA it only cost $199.99 (¬£150). The only upside to the delay in Europe was a slightly bolstered selection of games at launch, including; <i>Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i>.
	<p><i>Super Mario 64</i> marked a paradigm shift within the platforming genre. Gone was the flat, two-dimensional coin collecting and brick breaking. Now the 3D evolution of the game, which was built around the newly unveiled N64 controller, ushered in an entirely fresh generation of gameplay. <i>Pilotwings 64</i> is still regarded as a gem amongst the classic N64 titles, and even recently garnered attention from MVG on his most recent video, talking about how technically impressive the game was and still is!</p>

	<p>Almost six years after the 64-bit console released, the 388th N64 game was published; Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 (Aug. 20, 2002). 85 of these 388 games were exclusive to the Japanese market, USA had 49 exclusives, and only 4 games were released exclusively in the EUR region.</p>
	<p>Lifetime sales of the N64 hardware spiked at just under 33 million units across all regions, with the majority (20 million) being sold in America alone. Surprisingly, only 5.5 million consoles were actually sold in Japan, and 6.7 million units additionally across PAL regions, including Australia.</p>

	<h4>Regional Rivalry</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Nintendo 64's box art altered between the Japanese and North American release. Arguably the JPN box art is superior because it looks so damn good! The NA and EUR box art shared a more basic aesthetic that opted to list everything that the console offered.</p>
	<p>Almost all Nintendo 64 games and accessories have Japanese counterparts that have alternative box art, I always find it fascinating to see the regional differences when collecting variants.</p>
	<p>With just 7 games to go on my personal hit list to achieve the 388 world set, I wonder if I will manage to obtain every game cartridge before the N64 has its big 3-0!</p>
