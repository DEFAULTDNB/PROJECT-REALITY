		<h4>N64 Expansion Pak Line Up:</h4><hr>
		<p>It's a shocking statistic; less than 10% of the N64 catalogue is represented <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-nintendo-switch-online-switch/" target="_blank">officially on Nintendo's NSO online platform</a>. This week <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> join the ranks of replayable games, but how do they fare?
		<p>To date, there are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_Online_games" target="_blank">36 N64 games</a>, out of a possible 388, on Nintendo Switch Online's N64 Expansion Pak service. Japan has <i>Custom Robo</i> and <i>Custom Robo V2</i> as exclusives, while the USA and EUR regions have <i>Dr. Mario, Iggy's Reckin' Balls, Pokemon Puzzle League</i>, and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> as their exclusives. 
		<p>Notably, <i>Sin & Punishment</i>, a Japanese exclusive, has had USA box art added for its English language release that's exclusive to NSO, even though no such physical copy exists other than in bootleg form.
		<p>Nintendo is drip-feeding games across NSO at such a slow rate, that I'm beginning to doubt that the Nintendo Switch will ever see Donkey Kong 64, or Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, as the Wii U did (though there are at least two slots still remaining in the NSO N64 database).
		<p>Licensing issues aside, I feel that Nintendo is trying to get away with doing as little as possible when it comes to truly offering and preserving the games in a way that people can replay them faithfully, as they were intended to be experienced.

		<p>Nintendo is the keeper of the games, and also the ones DMCA'ing anyone who attempts to enjoy games that aren't even on their shaky platform. Why is N64 emulation on NSO so broken, and why is it acceptable for them to leave it in such a state?
		<p>The internal name for the N64 emulator is "Hovercraft" and it is based on the Wii U N64 emulator developed by Nintendo and iQue. It is used as a blanket emulator, in tandem with LUA config files, to operate with every ROM. While the emulator does bring a few features such as JIT real-time code compilation, RPT for texture replacement, and online multiplayer, it also brings a lot of game-breaking bugs thanks to this blanket approach and no game specific optimisations. Rather, they use LUA to bodge the games into running on an all-for-one emulator. 
		<p>How on Earth does this even pass QA??
		<p>Nintendo has seen fit to included suspend points, upped resolutions, and enhanced frame rates to play these games, though all we see is broken or missing effects, performance issues across the catalogue of games, and horrible input lag. That's not to mention a complete lack of a proper remapping function for the Joy-Cons or the N64 controller. The way the buttons are laid out, or worse, the requirement for you to switch configurations on the fly on a Joy-Con, is heartbreaking.</p>

		<h4>New Entries, New Problems</h4><hr>
		<p>It's incredible to think that Nintendo could mess up their own platform for playing games that are otherwise unavailable to play elsewhere (unless you own the carts). Somehow, they have taken a console so beloved by so many, and churned out crappily emulated versions of our favourite games almost every time.
		<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> is something we have dreamed of for a long time, with a solid story mode, cooperative, and now online multiplayer. But yet somehow this version, the version you pay your hard earned money for, is borked upon release.
		<p>For starters, the game chugs in a way that it NEVER did on OG hardware, there are sounds, effects, and textures rendering incorrectly, hiddeous input lag, poor analog controls, and to top it off, the controller bindings are useless: even with the BlueTooth N64 Controller.
		<p><i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> also suffers from heinous input mapping, missing screen effects, and memory Pak pop-ups that should have been patched out at very least. It's a poor showing for a game that revolutionised FPS games in 1997, that it can't be replayed seamlessly in 2024. 
		<p>Looking back at the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> release in January 2023, it was the same story. It still has not been rectified to make the game less janky to play and fix various issues that the N64 never presented. There was one patch released in August 2023 that addressed some texture and framerate issues, though it only served to exacerbate sound quality issues, and still has yet to be fully fixed.
		<p>Fundamentally, the methods deployed are sub-par at their core. Nintendo needs to up their game in the 64-bit emulation stakes, and rather than giving us half-assed emulation, give us guns blazing, cycle accurate playability with the option to enhance frame rates and resolutions, and the ability to correctly display all in-game effects across all games. A little care and attention would go a long way, and they could learn a huge amount from the <a href="blog.html#b3" target="_blank">N64Recomp</a> project!
		<p>Heck, 64DD emulation wouldn't go amiss either. We have known it's existence since the Wii U and 64DD games havn't ever been added to any Nintendo storefront.
