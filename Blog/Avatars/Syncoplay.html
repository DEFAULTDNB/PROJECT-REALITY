	<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Syncoplay! Let's kick-off this Q&A by describing your presence on social media for people:</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Syncoplay started when I was building small indie mobile games, inspired by the retro games I grew up with. When I decided to start selling a display stand that I designed for my game room, I repurposed Syncoplay into my retro game company. I have also run a YouTube channel, and am currently writing a book, under that name. Although at this point I mostly just post about obscure Famicom games :)</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My first console was an Atari 5200 with three games: Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Super Breakout. When I received my NES for Christmas at five years old, it changed my world - I would design levels for my pretend Mario-like game on graph paper and insist that others "play through them" with their finger. I was absolutely hooked on everything about games, which led me to follow the career path of game designer into college.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Nearly 3000 physical cartridges and discs, displayed in a game room that my wife likes to call "my sculpture" based on how much time I've spent trying to perfect it :) But I don't do sealed/glass case collecting - my games are meant to be played!</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Famicom is my favorite console, to the point where I decided to write a book about it. PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Switch round out the top three.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Since I've had kids, it has been much easier to play retro games than modern ones, given the limited time I have to play each week. I love to sift through old retro 8/16 bit stuff to find the weird stuff nobody is talking about. However, I have played through every From Software Souls-like since Demon's Souls (and King's Field before it), and I'm currently playing Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What snacks/drinks keep you both fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Bhuja snack mix, if I can get it. Stuff's amazing. I have an unhealthy Mountain Dew habit but I recently switched to Liquid Death sparkling water to try and stop drinking so much soda. Salsa Verde Doritos also.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My gold Punch-Out!! cart for Famicom, Summer Carnival '92 Recca, and Rule of Rose for PS2. Also, one of the only remaining discs for Narbacular Drop - the indie predecessor to Portal.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>I'm currently going for a complete collection of loose Famicom carts, I'm down to less than 50 left to obtain. Moon Crystal and Gimmick are going to be hard to get for a reasonable price though, and there's some really obscure Go/Shogi stuff that I still need to find</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Are you looking forward to any games in particular, regarding the recent N64 Recomp projects?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>The idea of N64 recomp is interesting, but to be honest I'm more of an original hardware / FPGA player. I rarely, if ever, play games on my PC so I haven't experimented much with the PC ports.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what are your combos?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>Chicken, Bacon, and a White Sauce/Hot Sauce mix. Add Feta if I get a fourth option.</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>My most valuable game is probably Rule of Rose, but I got it through a trade. The most I've ever spent on a single game is likely my copy of Summer Carnival '92 Recca for Famicom. I try to avoid the really high-value consoles like Neo Geo or Saturn because I already spent too much on games :)</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>And Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
	<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Syncoplay.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
	<p>You might need a firm number, but I'm not sure I can provide one. I have... a lot. I'll do the best I can.</p>
	<p>Original Hardware: 29 + about 15 duplicates</p>
	<p>FPGA/Clone Consoles: 8</p>
	<p>Arcade (MAME): 1</p>
	<p>PC</p>
	<p>So... roughly 39 if you don't count duplicates, over 50 if you do. (54)</p></div>
	<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
	<p>Duplicates definitely count! Thank you so much for your time and cheers for being part of ReCollect64 Q&A chats!</p></div>
