	<h4>Don't be Koi Koi</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>64 Hanafuda: Tenshi no Yakusoku</i>, or "64 Hanafuda: An Angels Promise", is a game based on Nintendo's origins, the Hanafuda flower cards. Back in 1889, Nintendo wasn't the technological company we know today instead; they were known as the maker of exotic cards. Over the decades, they diversified into indoor sports games, board games, knitting machines (yes, knitting machines), LCD laden Game & Watch devices, and eventually consoles.</p>
	<p>This game digitises the rules of the traditional "Koi Koi" game. It adds in a story mode with some strange dialogue by an odd cast, including a policeman and a baby. You start out as a lad who meets a girl who needs her bicycle fixed, one thing leads to another, and you're Hanafuda-ing!</p>
	<p>To play the game, you essentially have to match your cards to the ones dealt on the table and try to create themes or matching sets called "yaku". If you match a card, you take the two cards. The player with the most sets, or cards, in their pile wins. It's a bit like snap meets poker, where matching cards meet the river cards but with zero monetary jeopardy.</p>
	<p>Luckily, along with the tournament and exhibition modes, there is a training section for you to learn how to play, letting you absorb the games rules and mechanics.</p>

	<h4>Cards Against Sanity</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I have to admit, I was terrible at this game. The premise seems simple, but in actuality, it comes down to the luck of the draw. With a little practice, I managed to beat a couple of opponents, and with the magic that is the Google Translate camera app; I managed to roughly grasp what was occurring. Regardless, I was less than captivated.</p>
	<p>As card games go, it's fun for a short time, but this game doesn't appeal to me. Perhaps something is missing in translation, but I found it rather repetitious after a very short amount of time, and the fact that its luck base meant that eventually you will win, even if it sometimes seems like you constantly get dealt a terrible hand. Beating everyone and progressing feels monotonous to say the least.</p>
	<p>Hanafuda in general is not for everyone. I found it was extremely low energy compared to the action-packed titles that make the 64-bit system sing. Barring the striking colours and some snazzy 2D graphics; there isn't a lot going on. 64 Hanafuda Tenshi no Yakusoku never saw a release in America or Europe, probably due to the language barrier and lack of potential market sales, so it remains one of those games that will be reviewed more favourably by native Japanese speakers and Hanafuda-aware players.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Excellent card artwork.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Romantic storyline to follow.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No two player mode.</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>I'm not a fan.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>While it's fun for a hand or two, I couldn't eke out much enjoyment within the game. The art work and storyline put into the game are the shining USPs but beyond that, it sorely misses a trick by not even offering a two player mode.</p>
