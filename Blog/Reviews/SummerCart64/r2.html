		<h4>Whats New With You?</h4><hr>
		<p>As part of my ongoing N64 collection, I have recently purchased the SummerCart64, created by Mateusz Faderewski (aka Korgeaux), a brand new flashcart that not only plays your N64 ROMs and homebrew, but also plays 64DD ROMs without the need for conversion!</p>
		<p>Krikkz EverDrive 64 X7 has been my go-to for a while now, since I upgraded just after it was released in 2019, and before that I happily used the EverDrive 64 2.5 without issue. SummerCart64 stands on the shoulders of giants and takes multiple strides forward, building on everything that's great about the EverDrive series of carts and adds in features such as native 64DD emulation and heaps of developer forward features.
		<p>It should be noted that the SummerCart64 I bought was from Phemon Mod, meaning the casing is the version sold by Mena. Each store and supplier has their own build quality as it is assembled by a third-party, but the SummerCart64 hardware was designed by Korgeaux, and the N64FlashcartMenu software was developed by Korgeaux and Networkfusion (Robin Jones), as well as multiple other contributors, including Meeq (Christopher Bonhage) and Suprapote!.</p>

		<p>Some people will argue that clones are better value, and easier to get hold of. I have never bothered with knock-off devices because though they get the job done, they always seem to have some form of hiccup when it comes to durabilty and software support. I know plenty of people that have purchased a cheaper clone only to have it fail or quite literally fall to pieces just months down the line. This £120 pre-built model is extremely convenient, though for much less the unit is entirely self-buildable, 3D printable, and flashable!
		<p>The build quality of this Mena built SummerCart64 feels really nice; it uses a sleek plastic finish on its smoky grey exterior that feels wonderful even though it doesn't have the tactile texturing of the OEM carts. The cut-outs for the Micro SD card and the USB-C connector are recessed nicely (note: the SD card slot is miniscule and difficult to remove once inserted), and the hex bolt screws are a nice solid touch to hold it all together.
		<p>The first thing I noticed about the SummerCart64 shell is that there is a somewhat gangly button on the rear that clunks around a bit, it really needed to be spring-loaded, or just less rattly, to push it up even higher in the build-quality stakes buy the assembler, in this case Mena. This button can be configured to change 64DD disks, sending USB packets, or raising N64 interrupts for devs.

		<h4>Sleek Hardware with Great Software</h4><hr>
		<p>After formatting your Micro SD card to EXFAT or FAT32, you will need to <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/tag/rolling-release" target="_blank">download the latest sc64menu.n64</a> and copy it to the root to load the OS on your virgin SD card. Using a PC and card reader to drag and drop whatever you want onto the device and make any folders you wish is very simple, though you can also use the sc64deployer app on PC. The only stipulation is that the 64DD IPL files need to be stored in a folder called "menu".
		<p>Selecting N64 and 64DD ROMs is straight forward, select with A and then load with A, however, playing games like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit requires you to do the following:
		Select the N64 cartridge ROM (F-Zero X [J].n64), back out with B (don't load the game with A), select the F-Zero Exp Kit dump (NUD-EFZJ-JPN.ndd), then hit R to load the pair in tandem. While this works fine and only REALLY applies to F-Zero X and Dezaemon 3D, I still feel that there should be a simpler way to do this, it feels a little clunky in its execution.
		<p>At first, for the life of me, I could not get the thing to connect to my PC, so I couldn't set the RTC or update the firmware. I later found out through <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood" target="_blank">@LuigiBlood</a> that there were specific <a href="https://ftdichip.com/drivers/" target="_blank">Windows drivers</a> required to communicate to the device, and this allowed me to flash the update and sync the RTC to my PC with ease. 
		<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest" target="_blank">sc64deployer</a> app is for loading ROMs, updating, backing up, and debug terminal access. It's a command-line app and relies on commands to operate, but luckily, the <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/blob/main/docs/00_quick_startup_guide.md" target="_blank">SummerCart64 Documentation</a> covers everything you could possibly need to know. All I needed were the commands: "sc64deployer.exe firmware update sc64-firmware-v2.18.1.bin" and "sc64deployer.exe set rtc" to get me where I wanted to be with the device.

		<p>The load speed of ROMs is extremely fast from the SD card, and from my testing: EVERY ROM I threw at it worked perfectly without having to convert a single thing. Games like Morita Shogi 64 and Mario no Photopi are just about the only ones don't work on N64FlashcartMenu yet because they require further individual hardware emulation, but that's the same with any other flashcart out there, including the EverDrive X7. Backing up saves for sharing or modifying also worked brilliantly well and was exceptionally fast!
		<p>As you can see, the SummerCart64 is packed full of features and also includes ROM information with boxart support as well as compatibility for emulators within the N64FlashcartMenu OS. The emulators I used include Neon64 V2 for NES, Sodium64 for SNES, GB64 for Game Boy & Game Boy Color, and TotalSMS for Sega Master System/Game Gear and SG1000 (not currently working)! These emulators worked to a point; the SNES emulator is a little less refined, and there were some layer issues in games like </i>Super Mario All-Stars + World</i> but they played well enough to be enjoyable!</p>
		<p>The SummerCart64 is an incredible device, with blisteringly fast load times, compatibility across all regions for a vast selection of ROMs, plus the ability to play games like F-Zero 64 with the Expansion Kit without the need for the 64DD itself! What's more, the SummerCart64 project is completely open source meaning you will see community improvements, forks, and more, making it truly future-proof.
		<p>Mateusz Faderewski is the creator of SummerCart64's core hardware, firmware, and supporting software, and they have done a truly incredible job here. Bearing in mind that the SC64 began its life as a device for creating homebrew, its an incredibly well rounded package that can do virtually everything!
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy to load up & play<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>64DD emulation is a gamechanger<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Compatibility is through the roof!</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Rattly button on the rear (Mena shell version)<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Tiny, fiddly Micro SD slot<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Needs a GUI for PC connectivity</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>The SummerCart64 is a superb addition to any N64 set up thanks to its open-source nature and sub £100 price tag if you build it yourself. The plethora of options and modes available make this a superb developer tool and an astonishingly good flashcart to boot!
	<p>With community created menu themes and styles already popping up, such as a vibrant boxart-heavy <a href="https://github.com/ArthCarvalho/n64menu" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Online theme</a>, it certainly gives the EverDrive 64 X7 some stiff competition!
