	<h4>Museum Magic</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>On October 2nd, 2024, the Nintendo Museum will finally open its doors to the public! With exhibits containing wonderously presented artefacts, the flagship museum is a magical place bursting with history and overflowing with Nintendo's trademark seal of quality.</p>
	<p>With Uji City Kyoto being the venue, it's not going to be accessible to everyone, and I myself will probably never make that trip to go see it, as a trip to Tokyo is not on my adulting/mortgage paying agenda any time soon.</p>
	<p>All is not lost though, because I have assembled some of the best images of N64-related merchandise and exhibits for you to checkout without leaving the comfort of your own home, and slightly before the nostalgia-fest even opens!</p>

	<p>The Nintendo 64 is represented, as all other Nintendo consoles are, by way of a wall of console variants and games. Studded with facts and tidbits of information, each glazed exhibit gives visitors insights into the console's cumulative sales, accessories, and even some of the rarer games, console and controller variants, and addons the console accrued in its short five year lifetime.</p>
	<p>The museum also houses an impressive gift shop, stacked to the rafters with merchandise from every console (including '95s Virtual Boy and Satellaview). However, for the purpose of this article, I will focus specifically on the 64-bit goodies! I for one would love to fill my boots here. The keyrings and T-shirts are fantastic, but an oversized plushie controller would look ace in my gaming garage!</p>

	<h4>Various Variants</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I noticed that among the plethora of coloured controllers, the N64 exhibit has a couple of the rarer console variants in full glory for all to see. Namely, the gold console set, the Daiei orange and black console, and the Jusco grey transparent console. Each one is seemingly fully boxed and in immaculate condition. Without being there, I imagine the display describes how Toys R Us, Daiei, and Jusco (Japan United Stores Company) stores had their exclusive console variations.</p>
	<p>I had hoped that the display would feature more 64DD paraphernalia however, the selection in the images I have collated only shows a very small selection towards the bottom right of the first image (above). It would have been nice to see Nintendo delve into their archives and perhaps show us prototype equipment, original design sketches, and maybe even scrapped ideas or something really meaty and new to sink our teeth into.</p>
	<p>Sadly, Nintendo seems to be celebrating only that which was released, and none of the stages of evolution that saw the 64-bit machine through development. I would have loved to see mock-up controllers, unused logo ideas, prototype games, heck, anything that we haven't seen already!?</p>
	<p>I'm sure Nintendo is sitting on a vault load of unreleased imagery and concepts. I hope one day these things will surface, even if it is within another Gigaleak!</p>

	<p>The museum also features fully playable, giant-sized Nintendo controllers to play customised versions of their signature games. From the NES to the Wii all the controllers are fully functional and look amazing to mess about with! The Giant N64 controller (pictured below) takes two people to operate and is set up to play what looks like <i>Super Mario 64</i> from the <i>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</i> version from the Nintendo Switch. Each respective consoles games appear to be fully playable, and playing them encourages bonding, communication, and teamwork amongst participants. The N64 trident controller looks roughly 5 feet in width (1.5 meters) and is probably the largest fully working N64 controller in existence!</p>
	<p>We don't know yet if the games on display are interchangeable; maybe the N64 one is limited to just <i>Super Mario 64</i>, but perhaps there will be a rotation of games, so maybe we could see more first-party titles, such as <i>Wave Race 64, 1080° Snowboarding, or even Pilotwings 64</i>, getting some gigantic airtime.</p>
	<p>The Nintendo Museum opens on Tuesday, and hopefully more details will emerge on what games and events are held there, if and when they happen.</p>

	<h4>Honourable Mention</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As many of my friends know, I'm a huge Light Gun fan. Ever since the NES and <i>Duck Hunt</i>, I have had an affinity for blasting away at my TV screen, decimating anything that enters the playable area. Most recently I invested in some Sinden guns and installed a gun-centric Batocera build to replay all the classic gun games on one PC.</p>
	<p>When Nintendo unveiled the shooting gallery in their new-fandangled museum, my heart exploded with glee! The ability to use the SNES scope and the NES Zapper with up to thirteen players is astoundingly appealing, and the basic, child-friendly </i>Point Blank</i> approach of shooting targets and racking up competitive scores is incredible to see!</p>
	<p>Nintendo originally ran Laser Clay bowling alley shooting galleries back in the '70s as a way for people to simulate shooting and let off some steam. This modern approach is a fantastic way to celebrate and reinvigorate that heritage.</p>
