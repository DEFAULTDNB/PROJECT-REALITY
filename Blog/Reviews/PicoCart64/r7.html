	<h4>A Mighty Micro Machine</h4><hr>
	<p>When Konrad Beckmann came up with the <a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64" target="_blank">PicoCart64</a> concept, it was pretty novel. Building a working flashcart for N64 that costs next to nothing and was easily buildable at home. It was something of a tinkerer's dream.
	<p>Now that it has breached concept stage, there are three main versions of the PicoCart64 available to construct, so I opted for the 1.4 lite because it's the most stable version available right now. I may have to upgrade to a v2 down the line to check in with any updated features when they happen!
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>PicoCart64 v1 lite - The lite version using a Raspberry Pi Pico board capable of booting homebrew. This is the most user-friendly option as of now.
		<li>PicoCart64 v1 - The stamp version using a RP2040 Stamp from Solder Party. This is used as an experimental development platform for the next-gen version.
		<li>PicoCart64 v2 - The next-gen version which has two RP2040 chips, on-board PSRAM chip supporting ROMs up to 64MB, a WiFi module and SD-card support. This is still heavy in development. Don't build this unless you want to develop it.
	</ul>
	<p>The mainboard can be purchased from the <a href="https://lectronz.com/products/picocart64-lite2" target="_blank">Lectronz Store</a> for $5 and the Pi Pico for just $4 direct from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/" target="_blank">RaspberryPi.com</a>. That's the GBP equivalent of £8 before shipping and tax if bought direct from the stores and assembled yourself. It works out a little more (roughly £10-15 + shipping) if you buy one preassembled from a third party vendor.
	<p>By simply slotting the RPi into the mainboard and applying a little solder to each of the 40 legs, you'll build yourself a very affordable device that fits in your N64 and is fully flashable!

	<h4>Clever but Ultimately Arduous</h4><hr>
	<p>The PicoCart64 is smart but goes no further than granting a very streamlined experience, and there are no bells or whistles to be seen here. Preparing the hardware is very easy, and the process for flashing a game to the unit is identical. However, if you plan on playing multiple games in quick succession, it gets very jarring very quickly, as there is no luxury of a game select screen, cheats, or save management.
	<p>The upshot for this is that you can on one game, drill into it, and complete it without distraction or the temptation to instantaneously switch to something else. Because you can't.
	</p>
	<h4>Instructions for flashing/ROM loading:</h4>
	 <ol>
		<li>Download the latest firmware (<a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64/releases">Latest</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64/releases/download/releases%2F20240330/picocart64.zip">Stable</a>).</li>
		<li>Unzip either picocart64-v1-ntsc.uf2 or picocart64-v1-pal.uf2 depending on your N64 region.</li>
		<li>Hold down BOOTSEL and connect the Pico to your computer via USB-C.</li>
		<li>Copy over the *.UF2 file to the Pico.</li>
		<li>Once the file is copied over the Pico will reboot. It is now ready for homebrew.</li>
		<li>On the <a href="https://picoc.art/" target="_blank">UF2 ROM Builder</a> page, click "Choose file", and select the N64 ROM you want to use (must be in z64 format).</li>
		<li>Keep "Compress" checked unless you have a reason for using an uncompressed ROM.</li>
		<li>Press "Build UF2" and wait until the process is done.</li>
		<li>Hold down BOOTSEL and connect the Pico to your computer via USB-C.</li>
		<li>Copy over the *.UF2 file to the Pico.</li>
		<li>Once the file is copied over the Pico will reboot.</li>
		<li>Disconnect the PicoCart64 from your computer and insert it into the N64 console with the Pico facing towards the BACK of the console.</li>
		<li>Power on the N64 console as normal and your game will load.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>ROMs must be in z64 format (big endian), and in order to play some games, you may need to use <a href="http://micro-64.com/database/patches/S-Paladin.zip" target="_blank">Paladin</a> or <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools/obs-mot3.zip" target="_blank">MotetIII</a> to adjust the CIC. I managed to get it working on both my NTSC-J (CIC 610X) and PAL (710X) consoles with relative ease, and with ROM hacks working as well as retail games.
	<p>Barring having some issues with ROMs converting on the site, the PicoCart64 surprised me in just how straight forward the procedure is get to playing your legally backed up games. The big downside is that all the converted games need to be kept and stored elsewhere, like on your PC, as they cannot be stored onboard the device.
	<p>The proposed v2 version with twin RP2040s and SD card support could probably be programmed with a rudimentary interface to select raw, unconverted, ROMs to load into memory. Sure, it would cost a little more, but it would definitely be handy if it ever makes it out of development.
	<p>I could even conceive a version of the v1.x firmware that utilises onboard WIFI to network load ROMs, but sadly the developer himself, Konrad Beckmann, has sunset the PicoCart64 project, so no more updates will come for the forseeable future, unless someone else picks up the torch and runs with it.

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Incredibly cheap option<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy to assemble and flash</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>ROM building can be slow<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Developement has ceased</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>While the PicoCart64 definitely strikes at the hearts of the budget conscious, it lacks mainline features and offers a very bare-bones experience. It's fun and friendly to use, but the novelty wears off quite quickly with repeated conversion and re-flashing. You most definitely get what you pay for in the world of N64 flashcarts.
