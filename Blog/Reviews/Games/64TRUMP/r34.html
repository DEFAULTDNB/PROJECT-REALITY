	<h4>World of Wonders</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When I first fired this game up, I had absolutely no notion of what to expect. Was it a card game, an adventure, or something else? It sounds like an adventure, so I thought perhaps you could use cards like <i>Top Trumps</i> to power up your character's moves and enhance your game.</p>
	<p><i>64 Trump Collection Alice no Waku Waku Trump World</i> (64„Éà„É©„É≥„Éó„Ç≥„É¨„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ ÔΩû „Ç¢„É™„Çπ„ÅÆ„Çè„Åè„Çè„Åè„Éà„É©„É≥„Éó„ÉØ„Éº„É´„ÉâÔΩû) or <i>64 Trump Collection: Alice's Exciting Trump World</i> is a game based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> that revolves around resolving character disputes by playing hands of cards. There are nine chapters to work through in story mode, each featuring gorgeous, colourful <i>Paper Mario</i>-style animations and different card games. Notably, this game came out two years before <i>Paper Mario</i>!</p>
	<p>In story mode, there is an undulating story that is loosely centre on Lewis Carroll's tale, and you have to win card-based games to progress through each chapter. As a Japanese-only release, and as there is no translation patch available online, I didn't have an exact understanding of what was going on, but it didn't matter; it was easily trudged through without knowing the language.</p>
	<p>The standard mode is a compilation of twelve card games which includes Poker, Dobon, Old Maid, Black Jack, Daifugo, Klondike, Speed, Seven Bridge, and FreeCell. This selection sounds great on paper, but keep reading to see why it's an absolute mess of a game.</p>

	<h4>Down the Rabbit Hole</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Half of the games are wonderfully themed, and the other half look like they've been ripped from <i>Golden Nugget 64</i>. The cutesy pop-up book 2D styling is gone, and it's as if you're at a cold, lifeless casino.</p>
	<p>Why would they do this other than to either bulk out the content of the game or conceal gambling games within an innocent-looking release? Perhaps the former is the answer, because even <i>Golden Nugget 64</i>, which is a Casino simulator, got an "E for Everyone" certification from the ratings board. So exactly what is going on here in <i>64 Trump Collection</i> is anyone's guess, but I imagine gambling rules are far more strict in Japan.</p>
	<p>I found that the CPU constantly, unfairly, shook me down. In one example, I had the option to double up for a high card draw, and I drew a queen. It then asked "Higher or Lower", I obviously chose lower (because: probability), and a 1/13 chance King popped out. Shockingly, the house always wins.</p>
	<p>I found it even stranger that while playing video poker, you can press start, go to help, and it reverts to the 2D animated scrap paper look for that screen, only to revert to a large metal box to play poker on when you resume. Some games have full English menus; others are fully Japanese. Such an odd mixture.</p>
	<p>While the games are perfectly serviceable, this detracts from the overall feel that the game sets up through the cutscenes and opening levels. I have to admit it's disappointing to have so many styles, languages, and layouts to navigate, because "End Game" is never in the same place for you to escape it.</p>

	<h4>Dealt a Bad Hand</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Unless you're into high-stakes gambling, virtual card games are a dying trend. I remember playing Spider Solitaire on the LimeWire-infected family PC heaps before I had an N64; I have no idea why. I guess we must have had nothing better to do in the mid-90s, but everyone and their mums was playing it!</p>
	<p>The games work perfectly well, but they get very tiring extremely quickly. It would be infinitely more fun, and faster-paced, to invite some mates around, deal out a real pack of cards, and play some madcap drinking games.</p>
	<div class="col-container">
	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Vibrant graphic 2D art style.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy to pick up & play.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Odd realistic gambling machines.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>It's just card games.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>64 Trump Collection may look exciting in places, but the execution of digital card games is underwhelming. The pop-up book sections look fantastic, the realistic gamblers look out of place, and while technically all the games work fine, it feels extremely low energy, heavily disjointed, and it all gets too boring too quickly.</p>
