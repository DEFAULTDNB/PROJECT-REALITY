	<h4>Superlative Mario 64</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Today <a href="https://x.com/KazeEmanuar" target="_blank">Kaze Emanuar</a> has released the second demo for his highly anticipated <i>Super Mario 64</i> ROM hack dubbed "Return to Yoshi's Island".</p>
	<p>The hack is capable of producing 60 FPS on real hardware, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuvSqzfO_LV_QzHdmEj84SQ" target="_blank">years of extensive and well-documented research by Kaze</a>, reversing the game's source code, and even entirely rewriting it in places to produce the most amazing-looking ROM hack to date!</p>

	<p>The first demo patch, which was released in 2021, showed off all manner of hacks and patches that improved the engine that SM64 runs within. Demo 2 is another opportunity to check out the project's progress, with the focus being on testing out the camera system and movement mechanics.</p>
	<p>The C-Buttons control the camera as expected, but there are a slew of new camera controls, including first-person mode on the L button, you can recentre the camera behind you with the R button, zoom in and out with the D-Pad up and down buttons, and slowly rotate the camera with D-Pad left and right too.</p>
	<p>New mechanics include improved wall jumping, a new jump-spin when you hit Z to ground pound and then press A to jump again, and you can hold Z to spin/land faster when you bounce off a launcher, just like in <i>Super Mario Bros Wii</i>. The game also adopts lots of features akin to those you would find in <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, such as collectable red coins, coin-holding birds, new animations, and enhanced NPC interactivity.</p>
	<p>For the best experience, Kaze recommends you install <a href="https://parallel-launcher.ca/" target="_blank">https://parallel-launcher.ca/</a>, an emulator that effectively uses the Parallel core from Retroarch to play Nintendo 64 games on your chosen platform.</p>
	<div class="container">
	&nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
	<p>The purpose of the demo is to get feedback on Mario's polished movement and the new Camera!</p>
	<p>If you decide to play this demo, please fill out the survey to let me know what you thought about the new controls and camera!</p>
	<p>Survey link:<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZlXb-uyvHR0NoeX0b9sSDHnLogAAA0_qFn4xc7zmq2en2Bg/viewform?usp=dialog" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
	<p>Compatibility:</p>
	<p>This mod is console compatible and I have tried to make it compatible with as many emulators as possible.</p>

	<h4>Demonstrative Delights</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The ROM hack, which has been in active development since at least 2020, was due to release in 2023; however, Kaze has been perfecting his miraculous mods in order to provide an experience that almost seems impossible to have achieved running on unmodified hardware.</p>
	<p>With the optimisations made throughout the past several years, Kaze has managed to eke out performance gains, improve draw distance, number of objects on screen, fonts, textures, and models, and add a vast array of new features that show just what the game and console are truly capable of. For starters, checkout these features that have been added to the pause menu:</p>

	<p>Included in the updated patch are seven stars in the Bunny Brushwoods area, as well as a bunch of secrets including a hidden playable "stress test" area of Delphino Plaza from the GameCube title <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, and an orange Yoshi who exchanges coins for clothes and hints at possible future in-game shop mechanics.</p>
	<p>To play the game, you can either patch the 8MB Super Mario 64 U.Z64 ROM (MD5: 20B854B239203BAF6C961B850A4A51A2), or apply the BPS file to the ROM in Parallel Launcher. The hack runs on most flashcarts, and if you patched the ROM directly, you will have a 21.2MB *.Z64 file that has the MD5: A391CA7238F4411712C3EF9E8E23F514.</p>
	<p>I gave this a long play and it takes just over an hour to fully complete, including all stars and coins, and accessing Delphino Plaza, which feels wrong, but serves as a fantastic demonstration of the improved SM64 engines power!</p>
	<p>I am excitedly looking forward to the full release of <i>Return to Yoshi's Island</i>, and will be intently watching Kaze's progress in the coming months!</p>	
	<div class="info">
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.01 - Improved spinjump. Added more RAM and Cache clearing to hopefully make more ED OSes boot.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Snooplax shared a fix for anyone having issues with booting the ROM on their Everdrive 2.5 or X7: boot any other SM64 ROM hack first, move around as Mario and then reset the console and boot up Demo 2. I tried this and found that the SM64 Star Road Hack was the best to get it working 100% of the time.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.02 - Improved GPDive. Improved slide camera. Can cancel out of thwirling land.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.03 - Improved punching, egg coin radar, bossfight and camera, fixed a crash. Minor physics adjustments.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.04 - Added iQue player (chinese N64) compatibility.</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.05 - More per-area camera settings. Improved Mario's punch hitbox. Simpler camera controls. Improved Mario physics. Bugfixes</p>
		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 1.06 - Crash hotfix.</p>
