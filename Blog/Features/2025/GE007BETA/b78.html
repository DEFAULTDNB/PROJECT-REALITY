	<h4>James Bond: Stiff-Ass Brit</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Did you know that <i>GoldenEye 007</i> began life on the SNES? According to publications of the time, Rare was licensed to thrill on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in what would probably have been a sidescrolling stealth shooter. I say probably, because FPS games like <i>Doom</i>, though possible, wouldn't give themselves much overhead for creativity on the 16-bit system.</p>
	<p>As a two-dimensional shooting title, it would probably have played similarly to <i>Jurassic Park 2: The Chaos Continues</i> (1994) with its platforming, duck and cover, and run-and-gun mechanics derived from <i>Contra</i> (1987). Graphically it would have looked far more realistic than the cartoony look of JP2. Rare was well known for pushing capabilities, and pre-rendering animations and environments could have led to a pretty spectacular game for the ageing system.</p>
	<p>With SGI computers in the hands of the barn-based developers for <i>Killer Instinct</i> and the <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> series, it was only a matter of time before <a href="https://defaultdnb.github.io/ReCollect64/blog.html#b16" target="_blank">Brett Jones</a>, Steve Ellis, David Doak, Martin Hollis, and Graeme Norgate flexed their creative muscles on higher-spec hardware. We all know that the early beta footage of <i>GoldenEye 007</i> was an on-rails shooter; rather than having the freedom of movement around the environments, players would be shuffled from scene to scene in what was described as a <i>Virtua Cop</i>-style blast-em-up that would see enemies popping up from behind crates and peeping around walls, much like <i>Time Crisis</i> & <i>Virtua Cop</i>.
	<p>Luckily we have declassified documents from 1995, courtesy of Martin Hollis, that pinpoint the exact specifications Rare staff were working towards. Most intriguingly, parts of the document have been redacted, and notable movie features such as the Manticore yacht and the ending to Trevelyan's train were omitted from appearing within the game's levels.</p>

	<p>The game first debuted at Shoshinkai in 1995 demonstrating a very stiff camera system that pointed the player at the action rather than allowing them to discover things and develop set-piece gameplay and use their own steam to escape the situation. As mentioned in the documents, GoldenEye would strive to allow players to use weapons in multiple ways, for example, shooting glass out, alarms, cameras, padlocks etc.</p>
	<p>You can view that footage below:</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxUAUAUKxmA"></iframe></center>
	<p>The most notable thing about this build is that the weapons are never seen on screen. This is the first indication that the game is a rail-shooter, but just how the N64 game would function without a light gun is still a mystery. Perhaps the purported "Lunar Gun" that was set to appear on the 64-bit system (for games like <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> and <i>Sin & Punishment</i>) would have been the targeted peripheral for the game to differentiate itself from other FPS titles on the system.</p>
	<p><i>GoldenEye 007</i> was then shown again at 1996's E3 show, and still incorporated a predetermined camera system however, the weapons were now displayed onscreen and early shooting mechanics were now visualised.</p>
	<p>Here is the very short demo reel for <i>GoldenEye 007</i> at E3 1996:</p>
	<center><iframe id="" class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/42bPvXDAV7Y"></iframe></center>
	<p>Beyond the beta state of Silo's opening elevator scene, where in the final game the camera swoops down the entirety of the silo to see 007 at the bottom, ready to work his way up the levels; you can gleen several tid bits of information from this version. Firstly the enemy AI has not been implemented. The enemies do not react before being shot, as which point their system for giving them a death animation comes into effect. Secondly, the AR33 looks very prerecorded. The positioning of the rifle is also appears a little higher than in the final game, perhaps to simulate the player at home holding the gun, rather than it being a tad lower and in the hands of James Bond, who you are controlling. Lastly, there is still no HUD. No ammunition counter, no timer, no on-screen messages. There are also notably no aiming reticles or health bars on display here yet.</p>
	<p>The final video (below), from Shoshinkai 1996, shows <i>GoldenEye 007</i> in its final form albeit with no health bars shown yet again. You can see guards taking aim and shooting Bond, however no damage is taken, and this is probably due to the demo reel being made with cheats enabled to let them get the best action for the show. You can also see the repositioned weapons, the HUD, and the look ahead auto aim in effect as the silenced PPK automatically points towards targets. This 10 second clip also demonstrates the final movement, with the player finally assuming control of the character, and the movement looking far more interesting and unscripted.</p>
	<p>Ultimately, the game was completed in 1997 and published for sale in August. It featured the freedom of movement and iconic aiming system, with the full screen health bar, huge selection of weapons, 20-mission campaign, and the exquisitely brilliant multiplayer modes that we have all played to death, building and destroying friendships time and time again.</p>

	<p>The game contained a few mysteries, remnants of ideas that never fully came to fruition within the levels. First and foremost, the Dam's Island is still visible, across the expanse of water, but no boat is present, and no method to legitimately get over there and investigate exists. It was probably a beta objective that strayed too far from the movie's story beats to be viable, or it simply caused too many issues and the idea was a scrapped. Similarly, the Piton gun, which is mentioned in the briefing notes before the level, was never used. This gun would have been used by Bond to exfiltrate the level, firing a spike into the floor at the end of the bungee jump and allowing Bond to ease himself down into the Chemical Warfare Facility vents.</p>
	<p>Here are a couple more mysteries and trivia from the games production:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Silo saw a few revisions (even beyond the elevator scene from the 1996 footage), probably because it's not based on an environment seen within the film. The silo is the holding pen for missiles containing satellites, and the objective is to reach the top before the timer runs out whilst photographing satellites and retrieving circuitry. The beta had a vents section, similar to those seen in Facility, whereby you would emerge, climb a ladder, and begin the level. These areas are still located within the level; they have just been made inaccessible to the player. In the release version, it contains a floor-by-floor jaunt up the silo to catch Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, who is holding a briefcase. Within that briefcase is a key, and you can use that key to open the ceiling hatch above one of the missiles. This is also possibly a remnant of an objective that didn't make the cut in the final game.</p>
		<li><p>Runway was meant to feature a rideable motorcycle. Due to memory limitations, this feature was never completed, though a driveable, firing tank is usable within Runway (the same tank seen in Streets). <i>Perfect Dark</i> would be the spiritual sucessor to utilise personal vehicles as originally intended in <i>GoldenEye</i>. The model of the Runway motorcycle is visible, on a desk in one of the huts, in Surface.</p>
		<li><p>Frigate was originally named "Destroyer" and should have featured Xenia Onatopp as the helicopter pilot at the end of the level. The Frigate model used in the game is also not the same vessel as La Fayette that is seen in the movie.</p>
		<li><p>Statue Park was originally set in daytime with thick fog, rather than at night. It was also meant to be a multiplayer level and features a full setup that was never implemented in the final game due to slowdown and being too dark and dingy. You can unlock this level to play by using GameShark cheat codes.</p>
		<li><p>The Cradle level, based on the now destroyed Arecibo Observatory, was supposed to be a multiplayer level too however, it sufferes from big slowdowns and too much fog to be a suitable level. It could have been great for snipers! This level is also unlockable through GameShark codes.</p>
		<li><p>During production, Nintendo was keen to remove all blood effects, and routinely asked to see the blood in various alternative colours, including bright orange, green and blue. Having seen the latter, Nintendo agreed it looked strange, and they finally settled on red. This experimentation with colourful shooting possibly lead to the creation of the paintball mode cheat. One of my personal favourites!</p>
		<li><p>The Game Boy-looking "Taser Boy" is a secret weapon accessible only by enabling the "All Guns" cheat. Many people forget this weapon exists, and that it was shown off in beta as a short-range weapon capable of incapacitating human targets. The initial design was a lot more realistic, but the final design is more light-hearted and tucked away well within the game.</p>

	<h4>For England, James?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>GoldenEye 007 was also set to feature some incredibly intuitive and advanced external features for the time. The game was set to use the Rumble Pak accessory to simulate a guns magazine. Ejecting the Pak and reinserting it would have acted as the reload mechanism, at least for the machine guns and rifles that visually take magazines. This idea was quashed due to concerns that the accessory would succumb to excessive wear and tear, and the act of ejecting and reattaching the device could damage the controller's ability to read Memory Paks too. It would also require the player to own a Rumble Pak in order to play.</p>
	<p>Another idea was multiplayer system-link connectivity. The 1995 documents describe being able to play two-player cooperative modes with two systems. Quite how this would have worked remains a mystery, but Rare was well known for pushing systems to their hardware limits as well as software. For example, </i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> was meant to have items that were transferrable to its sequel, <i>Banjo-Tooie</i>, via a feature called Stop 'n' Swap. The idea was to collect a rare item like the ice key or the eggs in <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, then quickly remove the cartridge from the console while it was still powered on and pop <i>Banjo-Tooie</i> in its place to load the item from the first game into the second. This trick would utilise the hardware's memory to store the item from one game and overwrite it in the second however, yet again, it was nixed by Nintendo over issues with corrupting games and damaging the cartridge connection socket, as well as potential console hardware revisions possibly preventing the memory exploit from occurring at all.</p>
	<p>Rare always pushed boundaries, but it begs the question: why not just save the items to a standard Memory Pak, and load the save containing the special things into the other game sensibly? Perhaps it wasn't possible; perhaps it came down to memory constraints, but ultimately this is how Rare would handle Stop 'n' Swap when the games were re-released on the Xbox 360 in 2009.</p>
	<p>GoldenEye 007 remains one of the most critically and user-acclaimed games on the system, and forged new standards for the first-person shooter genre that are still upheld today, but not many people realise that GE007 was originally built without any multiplayer modes included at all.</p>

	<h4>We Aim to Please</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Do you remember the Nintendo Seal of Quality? Back in the 90s, the Nintendo executives were absolute control freaks. Every game produced for the Nintendo 64 had to go through a stringent show-and-tell system of critique by the Japanese company or their representatives before it could continue development. When Rare created <i>GoldenEye 007</i> in 1997, they had to show Nintendo the fruits of their labours, but the developers were troubled by the distinct lack of multiplayer options. The game was already running behind schedule. Rare had been given copious freedom to develop the game without these constant checks, but unbeknownst to the majority of the Rare developers and the Nintendo executives; multiplayer mode was patched into the ROM within a month of the final stages of production, and demonstrated to the top brass at one of their very last critiques.</p>
	<p>Thankfully, Nintendo loved it. The 11th hour addition of multiplayer gave the game more replayability, more couch-bonding sessions, and far more years of limelight than anyone could have expected. If it weren't for the team sneaking it in, along with some other easter eggs, then GE007 might not have been quite the same game we so fondly replay today.</p>
	<p>What other Easter eggs got snuck in, you ask? Well, the final code does contain a fully working ZX Spectrum emulator. How ROMs would have been loaded into it remains a mystery, but according to the developers the emulator could have been an unlockable cheat within the game. Could this explain the mysterious gap at the end of the cheats menu? Perhaps the ZX emulator was the 24th cheat to unlock, and ROMs could be transferred through the Memory Pak somehow? It's more likely that a cheat device such as Game Shark, Equalizer, or Action Replay would have been required to unlock the feature within the ROM and then upload the ROM to the game through a parallel port. This hypothesis makes far more sense given that the developers would have needed a way to connect directly to a PC in order to load ZX ROMs by "Ultimate Play the Game", aka Rareware, like <i>Saberwulf, Tranz Am,</i> and <i>JetPac</i>.</p>

	<h4>Yo, Jimbo!</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Lastly, I couldn't produce an article on GE007 without mentioning the fabled "All Bonds" cheat that many remember. Sure, the manual features an image showing a white tuxedo-clad character in multiplayer. This image was taken during production and was part of the game that would have allowed you to play as previous Bonds such as Dalton, Moore, and Connery. The problem was that their likenesses were all copyrighted, and so it was unethical to use them in a game based on a movie in which none of them appeared. They would also want paying!</p>
	<p>Many people misremember that this was entirely cut from the final game; no code for this exists. All that does exist with the ROM data is three alternate portrait images for Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton, though they were entirely inaccessible on the console. Even with GameShark cheats, it was impossible to recreate this mode or the characters because the assets simply do not appear in the files.</p>
	<p>I remember reading about this, looking at the image in the manual, and wishing it was true. Even with cheat codes, my friends and I could never get close to crafting a white tuxedo or modifying faces correctly. The best we could do was collect codes from magazines to unlock levels and blast through locked doors. Facility back-zone was a personal favourite for multiplayer, and who didn't fly over to the Dam's hidden Island if they had a cheat device in the late 90s?!</p>
