	<p>It came to my attention last week, over on Facebook, that a team from Craven Community College (N. Carolina, USA) has been engineering controllers for people with limited movement or disabilities, for N64, SNES, and NES. Here's what Spencer Ryan-Higgs had to say in his post:</p>

	<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> 
		<p>Recently, my team from college won a national engineering design competition with a video game controller. This controller is designed for individuals with disabilities that limit or remove mobility in one of their hands. As we all know, most controllers require 2 functioning hands to play a game.</p>
		<p>The controller's name is TYR (after a god from Norse mythology who lost one of his hands). Currently, it works on NES, SNES, and N64. We are working on the GameCube attachments next. This controller needs 3 components to function, an attachable/removable top control configuration, the attachable/removable circuit board cartridge, and the handle that everything attaches to.</p>
		<p>The handle has rotating button cylinders to adjust for finger length and left/right handed use. The benefit of this design is that control and board attachments can be made for any console, meaning a gamer can buy a handle and whatever attachments are needed for their consoles. This saves a ton of manufacturing cost not needing to design separate controllers for each system, making it cheaper for the end user. Since the controller circuit board is not integrated into the rest of the controller, this will also allow us to design circuit board cartridges for other devices, such as drones, etc.</p>
		<p>Now that our patents are pending, I can share this with you all.</p>
		<p>I've included pictures of the NES, SNES, and N64 configurations, as well as the docking stations that aid in attachment swapping with one hand. Our dream is for a company to pick this design up and put it out on the market. We've created 2 sets with every configuration so far. That being said, we don't have the manufacturing capability to produce these on a scale that would make a difference.</p>

	<h4>Promising Prototypes</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>As you can see, this project is inspirational, with a lot of care and attention taken to allow people of all abilities to enjoy classic consoles that otherwise have not had many disability-friendly peripherals.</p>
	<p>The combination of stock parts with bigger, better-positioned buttons, blended with the modular design and one-handed ease of use, certainly makes the TYR project one to watch in the future.</p>
	<p>I want to wish Spencer and his team all the best with their endeavours, I cannot wait to see how this project pans out, along with any future projects they embark on!</p>
