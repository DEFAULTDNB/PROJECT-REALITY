	<h4>Roger Moore & More</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p><i>The Spy Who Loved Me 64</i>, by VikingQueenJulia, is a modification for <i>GoldenEye 007</i> that transforms the first four missions in the game into scenes from the 1977 James Bond escapade. Putting yourself firmly in the shoes of none other than Roger Moore, you get to live out three of the main movie's story beats through Berngarten in the Alps, the JT Military Intelligence camp in Egypt, and the CFX Estate of Fekkesh in Cairo.</p>
	<p>Each stage contains varying objectives through each difficulty, with notable stage-specific tasks, such as finding the Union Jack parachute and escaping the mountain-top so iconically, meeting contacts, destroying weapons caches, disabling vehicles, and defeating the mini-boss, Sandor, whilst limiting civilian casualties.</p>
	<p>The fourth and final stage available is merely a showcase for the multiplayer roster. There are a slew of recognisable faces, including Nick Nack (The Man With the Golden Gun), Jaws, Francisco Scaramanga (The Man With the Golden Gun), Sandor, Feliccia, Martine Blaunchard, Major Anya Amasova, Raoul Silva, Karl Stromberg, Bond (Daniel Craig, Skyfall), M (Judi Dench, Skyfall), Mary Goodnight (The Man With the Golden Gun), Kincaid, Aziz Fekkesh, Felix Leiter (Live & Let Die), Quarrel Jr (Live & Let Die), Max Kalba, Naomi, Sheikh Hosein, Roger Moore (as Bond), and even VikingQueenJulia!.</p>

	<h4>Shaken and Stirred</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The V1 modification first came into the public light back in 2020, with VikingQueenJulia posting the xDelta patch to <a href="http://n64vault.com/ge-campaigns:the-spy-who-loved-me-64" target="_blank">N64Vault</a>, stating that the mod had been in progress for around 18 months and that it would be a full conversion akin to <a href="http://n64vault.com/ge-campaigns:goldfinger-64" target="_blank">Goldfinger 64</a> (which I will be reviewing soon).</p>
	<p>The mod has seen a few private iterations over the years, with a massive hour-long playthrough being provided by veteran GoldenEye expert <a href="https://x.com/Graslu00" target="_blank">Graslu00</a> in 2022 that showcased 11 levels (rather than the 3 in the public demo). The level select screen depicts Alps, Camp, Estate, Pyramids, Club, Ruins, Desert, Temple, Express, Docks, Lab, Roads, Sea, Hotel, Submarine, Liparus, Jet Ski, Atlantis, Funhouse, and Skyfall.</p>
	<p>Whether we get to see the mod in all its '70s patriotic glory in the future remains to be seen, but if you want to view gameplay of the most recent known build, then please feel free to give the video below a watch:</p>

	<h4>Nobody Does it Better</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game features lots of weapons seen in the film of the same name including; PPK (silenced), Beretta, FN FAL, SW model 10, Sniper Rifle, Astra 902/Cadix, Ithaca 37 (shotgun), grenades, S&W model 10 (revolver), Luger, SIG SG, M16, Colt and the Webley MK VI. I havn't seen it yet, but I certainly hope Stromberg's table gun makes and appearence!</p>
	<p>The mod also utilises custom music to set the feel of the film back several decades, including the brilliantly themed watch pause screen. This modification has style in spades; it is seriously worth checking out.</p>
	<p>Using the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> U Z64 ROM with an MD5 of 70C525880240C1E838B8B1BE35666C3B, applying the TSWLM_64_Demo_v1 xDelta patch correctly will result in the final file having the MD5: 2A5A8ACE2E15E3C30CF69294DE2C65BD. The mod runs fantastically on real hardware as well as via emulation, but remember that it is a <i>GoldenEye 007</i> mod rather than a <i>Perfect Dark</i> mod, so save type will need to be set to EEPROM 4k (if you have issues saving), and as with 99% of mods like this, an Expansion Pak is required.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Brilliantly engaging adaptation of the movie.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Excellent custom weapons, characters and music.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Huge levels, lots of places to explore.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Buggy textures and % stats in places.</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Three levels is just not enough!</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>Taking into account the fact that another build exists in private, on top of playing the already stellar three level V1 demo, I have to say that <i>The Spy Who Loved Me 64</i> is shaping up to be something incredible. Based on just the handful of playable levels I have played, there are bugs and small texture issues throughout, but I absolutely love the direction it's heading in and cannot wait to get my hands on it when it's finished!</p>
