	<h4>Big Bucks Boxed</h4>

	<p>Last month a factory sealed copy of <i>Clay Fighter Sculptors Cut</i> was reportedly found, and the information was shared by Valarie McLeckie on her Instagram page.</p>
	<p>What makes this so incredibly rare is that the game was one of only eight Blockbuster exclusives in the United States, and therefore copies of the game were opened in order for the now defunct video company to brand them with their stickers and allow people to rent the game out.</p> 
	<p>Having been verified and graded by <a href="https://www.cgcvideogames.com/" target="_blank">CGC</a> as a 9.4, this is only the third one ever found sealed. This one has two small "dings" in the bottom left corner (front side and back side), so it achieved an "A+++" grade, and sadly not a coveted "A++++" rating.</p>
	<p>The value tracking site <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/clay-fighter-sculptors-cut" target="_blank">pricecharting.com</a> has no known data for this level of unicorn, with previous, far lower graded efforts coming in around £11.5k - £12.7k. Current estimates on the price are falling around the six-figure range, though this is the first time a game like this, of this rarity and box-freshness, has been publically auctioned.</p>

	<h4>Sculpted Sales</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The game will be auctioned by Heritage Auctions, and in the meantime, Valarie McLeckie who works for Heritage Auctions, @valeriespiegel on Instagram, has posted a couple of short verification videos backing up the authenticity of the find, as well as pointing out how it's certifyable without even opening the box. The main point is the quality of the wrap, which should have a specifically smooth "buttery" tactile feel, an "H seam" running up the middle of the back and the top and bottom edges, as well as a row of tiny vent holes in the wrap, which is very rarely duplicated by people fraudulently resealing games for enhanced profit.</p>
	<p>Clay Fighter Sculptors cut is set to go to auction between November 22nd and 23rd of 2024 (next month!) under lot number #7382 of their signature auctions. I will be eagerly watching the progress of this and will report back the final sum and any additional information I can get about the sale!</p>
	<p>Personally, I need this game for my collection, but there is no way I could afford the regular well-thumbed boxed version, let alone a factory-sealed one. I will continue to aim for the plain cartridge-only version, which I imagine will be the last N64 for me to collect given its roughly £700+ price tag.</p>

			<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 23/11/2024 - The Auction ended for a modest $44,000 (£35,110), which is well under the predicted amount, but it's still a fair whack against the other previously sold items that achieved £11.5-£12.7k ($9,100-$10,100).</p>
