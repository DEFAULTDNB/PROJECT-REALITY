				<p>N64Ever has an astonishing website, that catalogs all regions, variants, and media associated with each N64 game. Naturally, I have scoped out the competition, and N64Ever's site is incredibly useful as a resource for learning about each title. Hopefully ReCollect64 can become as successful, and we can work in parity, in the future!

			<h4>Influencial and Humble</h4><hr>
			<p>Sad news today that RARE legend Brett Jones has sadly passed away. Best known for his work on N64's <i>GoldenEye 007</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i>, Brett also had an illustrious career in VFX artistry, working on projects including <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>.
			<p>On Twitter, various N64 scene members who knew Brett have posted touching tributes, including <a href="https://twitter.com/drdoak" target="_blank">David Doak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Graslu00" target="_blank">@Graslu00</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/foslerfer" target="_blank">@Foslerfer</a>, among others. People have been sharing Brett's fantasic artwork and celebrating his life with nostalgic posts from panels and meet and greets, which really demonstrates the strength and warmth of the N64 community.

			<h4>An Exhibition to Remember</h4><hr>
			<p>An exhibition of Brett's work from TV, film, and the gaming industry is planned to be held for two weeks from the 4th of November 2024.
			<p>If you would like to donate towards Brett's exhibition, there is a <a href="https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/Brett-Jones-artshow" target="_blank">link to his JustGiving crowd funding, which will go towards exhibiting Brett's artwork at the Atkins Gallery in Hinkley.</a>
			<p>Here at ReCollect64, we wish to extend our condolences to Brett's family and friends. We will certainly raise a controller in his memory, with a few rounds of GoldenEye and Perfect Dark to celebrate such an influential figure within the gaming industry.

			<h4>Ongoing Quest</h4><hr>
			<p>The hunt for Operation Cards never ends, and a couple of days ago, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/JosetteTrinkets" target="_blank">@JosetteTrinkets</a>, we now have a new one added to the ReCollect64 Operation Card repo!
			<p>Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 Kettei Ban! released in 2000, offering a comfy fishing experience designed by none other than Shigesato Itoi of Earthbound fame.
			<p>While originally trawling the net for Operation Cards using Nintendo's own servers, I also discovered <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n01/n64/software/nus_p_nibj/turicon.html" target="_blank">this oddly relevant and still functional link</a> for the Ascii Tsuricon fishing controller!
			<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Features/ItoiShigesato/ISTC.png"><div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Features/ItoiShigesato/ISTC.png" alt="turicon" class="center"/></div></a>
			<p>This card brings the total number of titles with an operation card to 49, so <a href="blog.html#cardtable" target="_blank">I have updated the original chart below to reflect this</a>. You can check out the new scans below!

			<h4>Are There More?</h4><hr>
			<p>The answer is, undoubtedly, but are there new individual titles to be found, or just regional variants?
			<p>I already know that there are Brazilian, Korean, Australian, and American variants of the standard first-party title's cards, and I also discovered that revised cards exist for million seller/players choice variants too, so there are definitely plenty to catalogue, though sadly, there are very few resources to find them on, and even fewer where decent quality captures have been made.

			<h2><span class="badge tech"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> <span class="title">DOOM 64 on DC</span></h2>
			<h5 class="subtitle">Sega DoomCast ~ July 17, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Covers/U/Doom 64 U.png" alt="DOOM64DC" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">DOOM 64 on DC</div></div>
			<h4>Ok Doomer</h4><hr>
			<p>Yes, you are reading this correctly! Thanks to the homebrew SDK/Operating System for Dreamcast, <i>Doom 64</i> is being ported and is now in the early stages of becoming playable on Sega's last home console, by JNMartin84 (of <a href="https://github.com/jnmartin84/OpenLara" target="_blank">OpenLara N64 port</a> fame in 2022).
			<p>Doom 64 originally launched for the N64 in 1997 and saw ports to modern consoles and PC back in 2020. As of July 16, 2024, you can now boot the beloved Nintendo 64 version on your homebrew enabled DC, experiencing the early stages of one of the highest critically acclaimed variants of <i>Doom</i> ever to grace a console.
			<p>There is work to be done, such as adding in enemies, audio and fixing the HUD and clipping, but the concept is sound and the stability of the port looks superb, and you can even try it out if you want to!
			<p>There are a few steps required to get Doom 64 working on the swirly console, but it's fairly straightforward once you have the KallistiOS (KOS) environment set up. Firstly, you need to obtain and use a <i>Doom64.z64</i> ROM with the MD5: B67748B64A2CC7EFD2F3AD4504561E0E, put the ROM in the WADTOOL directory, and then run the script to build the *.ELF and generate the required *.WAD files. Finally, you need to build a self-bootable CD or load from a HDD, ODE, or SD card, using your preferred method.
			<p>Full instructions are linked below on JNMartin84's Github and shouldn't take more than 15 minutes from start to finish. The results are basic for now, but incredibly smooth nonetheless, take a look:
			</p>

			<h4>What is KallistiOS?</h4><hr>
			<p>KallistiOS (spearheaded by <a href="https://github.com/gyrovorbis" target="_blank">Falco Girgis, aka Gyrovorbis</a> and his team) is a pseudo-operating system for Dreamcast that allows for RAM upgrades, HDD, Lightgun, SD Card Reader support, Broadband Adaptor support, custom BIOS flashing, and in it's most recent updates,KOS now supports virtual filesystems amongst other things. Built on GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) toolchain, KallistiOS is capable of utilising libraries from C++ to Lua, SDL, and OpenGL/OpenAL to deliver a modern, programmer-friendly, developer environment.
			<p>Recently, <i>Sonic Mania</i> was ported to DC using KallistiOS, and demonstrated network streamed assets working with app-level code ported to the system by <a href="https://twitter.com/SonicFreak94" target="_blank">Michael Fadely, aka SonicFreak94</a>, with an impressive 60 FPS locked performance!
			<p>The future of DC homebrew and ports is incredibly bright, and hopefully more decompiled N64 projects will make their way across for more people to play!

			<h4>Project (Virtual) Reality</h4><hr>
			<p>As many of you know, I love VR. I had a PSVR at the very beginning, upgraded to the PSVR2 and Quest 2, and then more recently, I've progressed into AR (augmented reality) and MR (mixed reality) by upgrading to the Quest 3. When I learned of VR mixing with my favourite topic, N64, I simply had to look into it!
			<center><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ha3fDU-1wHk"></iframe></center>
			<p>James Lambert, former Portal 64 dev, took up a new challenge in March 2024, and that was to create an outlandishly sounding; N64 VR hardware mod.
			<p>By utilising an Oculus Rift DK1 Developer Kit and building a custom USB module for I/O, James has managed to cobble together a method to use a VR headset on the 64-bit beauty, albeit at a very rudimentary level. The 2013 DK1 hardware has a basic resolution of just 640 x 800, and the sensor output over USB lends itself well to integrating into the N64 console, thanks to James' innovative thinking and N64 coding prowess.

			<h4>High Tech, Low Res</h4><hr>
			<p>At just 320 x 420 per eye resolution, the N64's Expansion Pak enhanced Hi-Res 640 x 480 output capabilities don't exactly make it an HD powerhouse, especially when it comes to being hardy enough to support VR output. Lowering the resolution to 320 x 240 affords higher frame rates, but excruciatingly grainy graphics in comparison.
			<p>Pyroxene put together a small demonstration environment to showcase and test the headsets tracking and gyro abilities, but as James comments, there is noticeable input lag, and it very quickly becomes nausea inducing.
			<p>Following the N64 VR project video, James added a second video in June showcasing his VR compatible Super Mario 64 ROM hack!</p>
			<center><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwbxGGJC3M4"></iframe></center>
			<p>With some amazing optimisations and some clever know-how, James has tapped into a retail game to bring it a new perspective. It's not perfect, but it works, and as such, it proves that virtually anything is possible!
			<p>I don't see this becoming quickly accessible to the public even with a mass-produced USB adaptor, nor do I expect anyone to want to endure motion sickness for such a niche project, so I wonder if this POC will go any further, to operate with FPS games or even homebrew such as James' own Portal 64 demake.
			<p>Regardless, it is truly incredible to view such projects and ROM hacks, and in case you were wondering, I will be covering Portal 64 soon because it is such an incredible project too!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 Q&A chats Space Station Silicon Valley! Please tell us a bit about yourself.</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>On this most recent account I was inspired by the Nintendo Dads. Their community was so wholesome and friendly, and I wanted to do the same thing for the retro gaming community, since that was my primary focus. Gaming circles can be very toxic, especially towards women, youth, and minorities. So I wanted to create a space where everyone can celebrate the games they like without fear of bullying.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My older brother had an NES when I was really young. But I'd say what cemented MY place as a gamer was getting the Donkey Kong Country SNES bundle for Christmas in '94. I was 9 and that game forever changed my life. It's still my favorite game of all time</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Mostly Nintendo starting with the SNES onward, but I have my love for OG Xbox and PS3 as well. I also like to collect strategy guides and vintage mags when I can find them cheap. Also I love action figures, but I usually don't spend much on them because they're mostly display items</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/SpacestationSV.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My favorite console of all time has to be the GameCube. I got it at a time in my life when I had a bunch of disposable income, and no responsibilities. So my high school years were FULL of gaming with friends on that little purple box. Melee, Double Dash, Animal Crossing, Gotcha Force, DK Jungle Beat, etc...</p></div>

				<p>I honestly don't do much with emulation. And when I do I try to keep the experience as authentic as possible. That's not to say I have a problem with roms or emulation. More power to you.

			<h4>New Generation of Emulation</h4><hr>
			<p>With the N64 turning 28 this year, it's only fitting that the games we know and love are still effortlessly turning heads and being played in 2024.
			<p>A recent PS4 emulator known as ShadPS4 by George Moralis and his team has come on leaps and bounds since it began life in July 2023, and today it has come to light that N64 classic <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> is now playable on the fledgling PS4 emulator!
			<p>ShadPS4 gives PC owners the ability to emulate PS4 titles on their powerful rigs, which is an incredible feat and is the latest of Sony's home consoles to be emulated since RCPS3 brought PS3 games to emulation enthusiasts beginning in 2011. RCPS3 is now a sensational and well-rounded emulator, giving hope that PS4 emulators like ShadPS4 can follow suit.

			<h4>Strength to Strength</h4><hr>
			<p>ShadPS4 V0.1.1 WIP is the latest version of the PlayStation 4 emulator, which now sees users getting into menus and even in-game in several cases. 2D games such as <i>Sonic Mania</i> and <i>Record of Lodoss</i> are virtually fully playable, and <i>Bloodborne</i> is slowly progressing into menus and I'm sure it will eventually get in-game soon, though depending on the hardware you're using to emulate Sony's PS4 console, you may have relatively low frame rates until it matures further. 
			<p>Given the emulator's relatively young pedigree, it's still amazing to see N64 games hitting the main stage, and it's even more impressive to see that PS4 games are playable on PC!
			<p>The next question is: do similarly remastered N64 games such as <i>Shadowman, Doom 64, Turok 2 Seeds of Evil</i>, and <i>Turok 3 Shadow of Oblivion</i> run too?
			<p>I will definitely look into this more!

			<h4>Bring Your Own ROM</h4><hr>
			<p>On July 6th, 2024, developer Klorfmorf gifted the world a pre-release recompiled PC port of the N64 classic, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon. This was released via their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/KzaXHwh" target="_blank">Discord server</a> and touts a launcher similar to the recent <i>Majoras Mask</i> N64Recomp release (interestingly, the main *.exe still uses the <i>Majorask Mask</i> icon), widescreen support, 60 FPS, and bindings for modern controllers.
			<center>
			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560">
			<p lang="en" dir="ltr">someone on a goemon discord server I&#39;m in released a recompilation for MNSG, and getting to play the game in widescreen and 60fps is such a blessing (though the recomp only supports the japanese version AFAIK) <a href="https://t.co/6KwhkcSZTs">pic.twitter.com/6KwhkcSZTs</a></p>&mdash; stoopidmansidiot (@rondleman)

			</center>
			<p>The news was initially shared by user <a href="https://twitter.com/rondleman" target="_blank">@Rondleman on Twitter</a> but has since been shared on various news sites along with a link to the initial release executables, which can be found below.
			<p>As per all N64Recomp releases, you must supply your own ROM to use this port and keep it legal to redistribute. This time, the ROM required is the Japanese version: <i>Ganbare Goemon Neo Momoyama Bakufu no Odori [J].z64</i>
			<h4>Preliminary Release</h4><hr>
			<span align="center" width="100%">

			</span>
			<p>As you can see, the game looks stunning, but it is still lacking a few touches, such as HD textures, a proper widescreen HUD, and various performance/effects fixes before it can be considered a full-fledged release. Regardless, it is hugely encouraging to see more decompiled games getting a modern treatment.
			<p>One thing you should bear in mind is that it is currently all presented in Japanese, so it might be a little tougher to play through if you aren't well versed in the language. I'm sure an English version of the Recomp will follow soon enough.

			<h4>Innovation from Inspiration</h4><hr>
			<p>When it comes to looking back over games you used to play, do you also recollect the ways you used to play them? Which modes did you favour, which controllers, and which configurations.
			<p>My friends and I hammered GoldenEye. To the point that we knew every spawn point, every weapon, and every quirk each other had, but the one thing we didn't have were separate screens. Everytime we played, there was the constant fear of screen-cheating, and there was no where to hide, no let up to the barrage of action, and games were more frantic in front of a TV sat on a sofa. We played two-player games more often than four-player because the screen size was larger, the frame rate was better, and the people waiting their turn got rowdy chanting and goading us on in the background.
			<p>Beyond the loadout, past the modes and the configurations, we strived for more competitive play, and over time I had various bright ideas that would revolutionise our sessions.
			<p>I would take a simple piece of paper, the width of my 26" Goodman's TV, and tape it across the middle of the TV screen to give each portion of the screen some privacy. The idea was simple, a divider, and with some seating adjustments, it worked, just about. Player one sat on a chair, and player two hunched down on the floor. The two of us could play on separate screens, but I wasn't happy with this creation it was too makeshift.
			<p>My Magnum Opus came as I remembered that my old 13" CRT was rotting up in the loft, and that there was a second 12" TV/VCR combo in my sister's room. There was a spark, and I immediately got to creating my ultimate gaming setup!
			<p>I placed two chairs back to back in the middle of my bedroom, and using one N64, I put a splitter on the RF cable, connected two more RF cables, I then hooked up one cable to one TV and another to the second. I placed the N64 between the two chairs, on the floor, this gave equal cable length to each player, and it kept the console close to the TV's to minimise any trip hazards. I plugged it in to test my work. It was like a miniature LAN party, but in 1998!
			<p>The final stage of this contraption was to place cushions in front of the TVs for each player to sit on, and then cover alternate halves of each TV with a piece of card. This meant that each player only had visual access to their half of the screen, and there would be no opportunity to cheat.

			<h4>Contraption Conclusion</h4><hr>
			<p><i>GoldenEye, Perfect Dark,</i> and <i>Turok 2</i> multiplayer forced us to try out new tactics and rethink the usual way we played by having at least a little forewarning that someone was lurking around the corners. Sniping and closequater combat became edge-of-your-seat experiences because you simply couldn't nail down where someone was firing from, and you had no idea if anyone was creeping directly behind you.
			<p>I remember wanting to push this one further, with a four-way splitter, four chairs back to back, four TVs, bigger TVs (!), and four pieces of "L"-shaped cardboard to caudon off other players screens. I also remember the impracticality of borrowing four chairs, power strips, and four TVs, let alone making this for comfortable use in a bedroom.
			<p>Alas, a mythical four-way (play session) was not to materialise in my teenage bedroom.
			</p>
			<h4>Enter The Arena</h4><hr>
			<p>Though my setup was technically smart, it required a few components most people wouldn't have had lying around, so I was fortunate to have had the bits needed and patient friends who would help me test out my contraption.
			<p>The Computer-Systems Arena was an almost comically priced $63 piece of hardware that deployed mirrors to reflect portions of the screen at their respective players. It's not wholly elegant, but it's effective once jostled into place, and it could work on up to 27" screens.
			<p>Reviews of this peripheral were relatively positive at the time (2000), with the only unavoidable complaint being the amount of space required to set it up properly. The positivity from this new challenging way to play oozes from the majority of the other reviews, which stated that it felt weird not knowing where people are and makes the game feel akin to PC multiplayer, i.e. one screen per player.
			<p>The Arena was a commercial product that would have given a similar experience to the contraption I built a few years prior. This suggests to me that I wasn't alone in wanting this type of experience from my gaming sessions, though sadly, I never so much as saw an Arena in real life, let alone heard of its existence, until very recently.

			<h5 class="subtitle">InterAct Arcade Shark ~ July 5, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/ArcadeShark/ArcadeShark.png" alt="ArcadeShark" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">Arcade Shark</div></div>
			<h4>A Sharks Tale</h4><hr>
			<p>Recently I performed a short analysis on the <a href="blog.html#b5" target="_blank">N64's catalogue</a> and noted that of the 388 titles, there are 36 fighting games. That accounts for nearly 10% of the Nintendo 64's entire library, and so it makes sense that none other than InterAct would jump at the opportunity to make a peripheral for the 64-bit wonder.
			<p>The InterAct Arcade Shark does exactly what it says on the tin: it's an arcade stick in all of its form and function and doesn't attempt to be anything else!
			<p>Conceived in 1996, the N64 wouldn't exactly have had too may games around the time of launch. <i>War Gods, Ki Gold, MK Trilogy</i>, and perhaps even the lacklustre <i>MK Mythologies Sub-Zero</i> would have been all that was available in the first year, so it was slim pickings until 1997, when MK4 and Mace the Dark Ages arrived. 1998 was even better for fighting games, with the likes of <i>Fighters Destiny, Bio F.R.E.A.Ks, G.A.S.P.</i>, and <i>Flying Dragon</i> appeared. It wasn't until midway through the N64's lifespan, 1999, that the first installment of the wildly popular fighting series <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> was released.
			<p>I managed to bag mine a few months ago after lusting after one for many years. For the pincely sum of £34.99, I won a boxed one in immaculate condition, and with PriceCharting stating that the current loose price averages £31 and a boxed price circles roughly £89, I was pretty pleased with my purchase!
			<p>Being that this was produced in 1996, I can verify that this sadly doesn't work with a Rumble Pak. I tried plugging it in to a compatible game and it just sent the analog stick doolally.

			<h4>Fresher than a Thresher</h4><hr>
			<p>With titles such as the four <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games, <i>Killer Instinct Gold, Super Smash Bros.</i> and <i>Fighters Destiny</i> at the fore of the N64's fighting roster, there are some real bangers on the system.
			<p>I tested out the aforementioned titles, and I have to say the Arcade Shark is a pretty fierce piece of kit, but I have a few qualms. The buttons feel great, but they're not raised enough on the C-Buttons, it would have been great to have all of the face buttons given the same treatment, just coloured appropriately. Instead we have the A and B buttons along with the L, R, and Z buttons standing proud like real arcade buttons, whereas the C-Button cluster is markedly smaller and flatter. The net result is that your fingers gravitate towards the L and R buttons, which, in <i>KI Gold</i> and most fighting games on N64, do nothing.
			<p>Other games fare similarly with the same button-feel issues rearing their heads. Perhaps it's a matter of muscle memory, and perhaps I need to throw a lot more time into fighting games (I rarely play them), but as a casual device, I found those C-Buttons a bit annoying.
			<p>The stick is great, it's responsive, and it works across both the D-Pad and analog stick slots, but, and this is a big but, the stick tended to twist loose during play. I had to really screw it in hard to prevent any movement, because in the heat of a fighting game you really do push those little ball-top sticks to their upper limits, and you tend to unknowingly tilt harder when under the pump.
			<p>Don't get me wrong, the stick feels great, but it needed a little refining to be perfect. The fact that only one stick is supplied is also a possible issue. A spare is always welcome, but would you ever need to plug two in at once? The sensible answer is no, but the inquisitive answer is; it would have been cool to have the option. 
			<p>No game really sees you switching from stick to D-Pad and back again, so it's a moot point, however, were you to play a game like <i>Mario Kart 64</i> and want to steer with one and flick the other to adjust your camera or the HUD, it would have been nice. As it stands, the circular base you screw the stick into can be used as a flat D-Pad or analog stick without the stick plugged in, which is handy.
			<p>I suppose this is a better method than having just one stick slot and a switch to swap the D-Pad function to analog stick or vice versa, but the downside of that idea is that you couldn't use the screw in stick in the middle position to make the entire pad work more comfortably for smaller hands in all games.
			<p>The Arcade Shark is oversized, and it weighs well over a kilo, so it's best to use it on a surface rather than your lap for best effect, unless you enjoy dead legs.
			</p>
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Solid arcade style fighting stick<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Also great for Shoot 'em ups</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Only one stick supplied<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>The C-Buttons are too flat<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Not Rumble Pak compatible</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>InterAct's Arcade Shark hits hard as a fight stick, but has a few annoying traits. If you're a fan of the fighting genre then this is a great purchase to really get the coin-op experience from the utra hardware, but if you're thinking about using it on any other genre of game, think again.

			<h4>Cooperative Kooper Crushing</h4><hr>
			<p>After Super Mario 64 was decompiled back in 2019, modders have been beavering away at the PC build, restoring beta or lost features, adding content, and giving SM64 the quality of life updates it deserves.
			<p>The original teams that were SM64EX-Coop and SM64CoopDX have recently merged together to form one uber modding team under the mantle: SM64CoopDX, to deliver the best experience possible for end users. The net result is a lot of features and no need to manually patch anything; it's all done very conveniently in the distributed executable. 
			<p>Helmed by AgentXLP, and formerly djoslin0 of SM64EX-Coop, Super Mario 64 Coop DX has a simple goal in mind: to bring online multiplayer with synchronisation of enemies and objects to Super Mario 64, and boy, have they done it in style!

			<p>The main premise of this mod is to allow you to customise your player (no, you don't have to play as Mario), or alternatively you can be Yoshi, Toad, Waluigi, or Peach, with a number of customisations to recolour the characters the way you want them to look. I opted to recreate "The Green Thunder", Mr. L, but opted to play as Metal Mario because it just looked way cooler! Once you have your player ready, you can then invite your friends to come and smash up the Mushroom Kingdom with you.
			<p>Custom characters have custom movesets, so Peach/Daisy have a floaty double jump, which is perfect for speedily getting across gaps that Mario could never have dreamed of making back in 1996.
			<p>In order to play the game, all you need to do is download the latest release for your platform, run the *.exe, and drag your Super Mario 64 (U).z64 file into the window. After that, run the language config, choose your mods, and either host or join a game!

			<h4>Nostalgic but New</h4><hr>
			<p>A variety of ROM hacks have also been ported to SM64CDX, including Star Road, Super Mario 74, and more, such as the "Hide and Seek", and "Extra Characters". You're also free to download mods and put them in your install directories aptly named "mods" folder to add to the fun! One of the coolest modifications I spotted was that of a day and night cycle. Which led to some stunning views of Peaches Castle at three different times of day!

			<p>At the time of writing, V1.0 is the latest release from July 1st, 2024. This version is the culmination of previous efforts and adds updated character models for Waluigi and removes some of the preset palettes to motivate creativity. 
			<p>I urge anyone with a PC and a hankering for playing Super Mario 64 in 60 FPS glory cooperatively to scoop up SM64CDX ASAP, because it's incredibly fun and extremely intuitive.
			<p>Quality of life features mean the game feels fresh, it looks clean and it runs like a dream even on the most outdated of PC hardware. Small in-game changes also allow for players to bump and jump off one another, making for some truly riotous moments!

			<h5 class="subtitle">PicoCart64 Lite V1.4 ~ July 3, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/PicoCart64/PicoCart64.png" alt="PicoCart64" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">PicoCart64 Lite V1.4</div></div>
			<h4>A Mighty Micro Machine</h4><hr>
			<p>When Konrad Beckmann came up with the <a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64" target="_blank">PicoCart64</a> concept, it was pretty novel. Building a working flashcart for N64 that costs next to nothing and was easily buildable at home. It was something of a tinkerer's dream.
			<p>Now that it has breached concept stage, there are three main versions of the PicoCart64 available to construct, so I opted for the 1.4 lite because it's the most stable version available right now. I may have to upgrade to a v2 down the line to check in with any updated features when they happen!
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PicoCart64 v1 lite - The lite version using a Raspberry Pi Pico board capable of booting homebrew. This is the most user-friendly option as of now.
				<li>PicoCart64 v1 - The stamp version using a RP2040 Stamp from Solder Party. This is used as an experimental development platform for the next-gen version.
				<li>PicoCart64 v2 - The next-gen version which has two RP2040 chips, on-board PSRAM chip supporting ROMs up to 64MB, a WiFi module and SD-card support. This is still heavy in development. Don't build this unless you want to develop it.
			</ul>
			<p>The mainboard can be purchased from the <a href="https://lectronz.com/products/picocart64-lite2" target="_blank">Lectronz Store</a> for $5 and the Pi Pico for just $4 direct from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/" target="_blank">RaspberryPi.com</a>. That's the GBP equivalent of £8 before shipping and tax if bought direct from the stores and assembled yourself. It works out a little more (roughly £10-15 + shipping) if you buy one preassembled from a third party vendor.
			<p>By simply slotting the RPi into the mainboard and applying a little solder to each of the 40 legs, you'll build yourself a very affordable device that fits in your N64 and is fully flashable!

			<h4>Clever but Ultimately Arduous</h4><hr>
			<p>The PicoCart64 is smart but goes no further than granting a very streamlined experience, and there are no bells or whistles to be seen here. Preparing the hardware is very easy, and the process for flashing a game to the unit is identical. However, if you plan on playing multiple games in quick succession, it gets very jarring very quickly, as there is no luxury of a game select screen, cheats, or save management.
			<p>The upshot for this is that you can on one game, drill into it, and complete it without distraction or the temptation to instantaneously switch to something else. Because you can't.
			</p>
			<h4>Instructions for flashing/ROM loading:</h4>
             <ol>
				<li>Download the latest firmware (<a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64/releases">Latest</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kbeckmann/PicoCart64/releases/download/releases%2F20240330/picocart64.zip">Stable</a>).</li>
				<li>Unzip either picocart64-v1-ntsc.uf2 or picocart64-v1-pal.uf2 depending on your N64 region.</li>
				<li>Hold down BOOTSEL and connect the Pico to your computer via USB-C.</li>
				<li>Copy over the *.UF2 file to the Pico.</li>
				<li>Once the file is copied over the Pico will reboot. It is now ready for homebrew.</li>
				<li>On the <a href="https://picoc.art/" target="_blank">UF2 ROM Builder</a> page, click "Choose file", and select the N64 ROM you want to use (must be in z64 format).</li>
				<li>Keep "Compress" checked unless you have a reason for using an uncompressed ROM.</li>
				<li>Press "Build UF2" and wait until the process is done.</li>
				<li>Hold down BOOTSEL and connect the Pico to your computer via USB-C.</li>
				<li>Copy over the *.UF2 file to the Pico.</li>
				<li>Once the file is copied over the Pico will reboot.</li>
				<li>Disconnect the PicoCart64 from your computer and insert it into the N64 console with the Pico facing towards the BACK of the console.</li>
				<li>Power on the N64 console as normal and your game will load.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>ROMs must be in z64 format (big endian), and in order to play some games, you may need to use <a href="http://micro-64.com/database/patches/S-Paladin.zip" target="_blank">Paladin</a> or <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools/obs-mot3.zip" target="_blank">MotetIII</a> to adjust the CIC. I managed to get it working on both my NTSC-J (CIC 610X) and PAL (710X) consoles with relative ease, and with ROM hacks working as well as retail games.
			<p>Barring having some issues with ROMs converting on the site, the PicoCart64 surprised me in just how straight forward the procedure is get to playing your legally backed up games. The big downside is that all the converted games need to be kept and stored elsewhere, like on your PC, as they cannot be stored onboard the device.
			<p>The proposed v2 version with twin RP2040s and SD card support could probably be programmed with a rudimentary interface to select raw, unconverted, ROMs to load into memory. Sure, it would cost a little more, but it would definitely be handy if it ever makes it out of development.
			<p>I could even conceive a version of the v1.x firmware that utilises onboard WIFI to network load ROMs, but sadly the developer himself, Konrad Beckmann, has sunset the PicoCart64 project, so no more updates will come for the forseeable future, unless someone else picks up the torch and runs with it.

			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>While the PicoCart64 definitely strikes at the hearts of the budget conscious, it lacks mainline features and offers a very bare-bones experience. It's fun and friendly to use, but the novelty wears off quite quickly with repeated conversion and re-flashing. You most definitely get what you pay for in the world of N64 flashcarts.

				<h4>Deep Diving</h4><hr>
				<p>Whilst building ReCollect 64's main collection app, I have devised list after list of things I need to add, fix, or look into. I recently found some time to focus on one subject, so I began looking into Operation Cards, the foldable piece of paper included with the manual, and any other items of paperwork you may find in a boxed game. Not every game came with one, and not all regions had them. I didn't remember having any whilst collecting a PAL set (though I focused on carts over CIB), and I don't own a single one in any of the games I've purchased boxed from any other regions.
				<p>Operation cards, or quick start guides, are designed to give you the bare basics it would take to perform the majority of moves, or abilities of your character depending on the game. Wave Race 64, for example, lays out the instructions for how to change the camera angle, shift your weight on the Jet Ski, or dampen the waves with the "B" button. The flip-side of the page explains all the tricks and stunts you can do, it's a compact and colourful way to quickly reference important features without having to read tonnes, or hold a manual in front of you while you play.  
				<p>When I began searching, my first Google hit came from <a href="https://thechozoproject.com/n64-operation-card-archive/" target="_blank">The Chozo Project</a> and the writers footing into USA Operation card hunting. I noted several things when scouring that site, firstly, it's a great insight into the owners collecting mentality, but secondly, it felt a tad untapped. Sure, it was a tremendous starting point, but I knew there were more out there to discover.
				<p>With this thought lodged firmly in my brain, I contacted a person I knew would have some insight into the matter, an absolute fountain of knowledge: <a href="https://twitter.com/JosetteTrinkets" target="_blank">@JosetteTrinkets</a>. We had a lengthy conversation regarding these over the course of several days, over which time we really dug into these cards and got a grasp on what games had them, and in which regions. We exchanged countless messages exclaiming a new find, and eventually figured out ways to mine Nintendo's own Virtual Console servers for scanned treasure.

				<p>Finding them was as simple as combining an NUS ID into the known URL. For example, <a href="https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/NUS/JPN/NCZJ/NCZJ_J.pdf" target="_blank">https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/NUS/JPN/NCZJ/NCZJ_J.pdf</a> opens up the Custom Robo V2 Operation Guide and manual, so editing the end of the URL to <a href="https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/NUS/JPN/NWRJ/NWRJ_J.pdf" target="_blank">NUS/JPN/NWRJ/NWRJ_J</a> instantly bagged us the JPN Operation card for Wave Race 64 (as an example), though changing it to <a href="https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/NUS/USA/NWRE/NWRE_E.pdf" target="_blank">NUS/USA/NWRE/NWRE_E</a> (USA) or <a href="https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/NUS/EUR/NWRP/NWRP_P.pdf" target="_blank">NUS/EUR/NWRP/NWRP_P</a> (European) only holds manuals for these regions 🙁.
				<p>As you can see, hitting Japanese links yielded results, but it was still too hit and miss. A lot of games, particularly third-party ones, were not stored on Nintendo's servers, so I invested some (a lot) of time in scouring the global eBay sites to figure out which games we were even looking for!
				<p>Below is a list of games I formulated based on my findings and with <a href="https://twitter.com/JosetteTrinkets" target="_blank">@JosetteTrinkets</a> valuable insights. Together, we managed to find the majority of JPN ones at a decent quality, but others we had to nab from random auction sites around the world:

				<h4>The Hunt Continues!</h4><hr>
				<p>The majority of games that contained these cards came from Japan, with very few coming from PAL regions at all. Of the all the titles identified, we managed to find almost every available one for NTSC-J! We also confirmed a tenth USA one (<i>Hey You, Pikachu!</i>) and I spied a sneaky -1 variant of the <i>Mario Kart 64</i> one that would have come with a revision, or second print, of the cart later on. Hopefully the writer of <a href="https://thechozoproject.com/n64-operation-card-archive/" target="_blank">The Chozo Project</a> site (Zach Lindemann) will read this someday and revel in our obsessions!
				<p>While researching, I also spotted evidence of Korean, Hong Kong, Australian, and even Brazilian Operation Cards, so the quest to find them all will expand into these quirky regions. I highly suspect that the main titles depicted here will share cards regionally, with <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, for example, having one for Japan, USA, Korea, and Australia, so it stands to reason that a version should exist for Brazil, and so on.
				<p>I will be continuing my efforts to uncover more, and all that remains now is an ongoing hunt for the illusive ones that are still widely unseen. I have already uploaded everything we have found so far to <a href="https://github.com/DEFAULTDNB/ReCollect64/tree/main/Operations" target="_blank">my repository</a> because they will be added to the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">ReCollect64 Collectors App</a>, for anyone to access properly in the next update!
					<div class="info">
					<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 04/07/2024 - <i>Yuke-Yuke Trouble Makers</i> found and archived, and HKG <i>Cruis'n USA</i> has been added to the chart as a potential title.</p>
					<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 17/07/2024 - <i>Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri</i> found and archived!</p>

			<h2><span class="badge tech"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i></span> <span class="title">Super Mario 64 GBA Port</span></h2>
			<h5 class="subtitle">Portable Plumber Power! ~ June 29, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Features/SM64GBA/SM64GBA.png" alt="N64 Stats" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">SM64 GBA Port</div></div>
				<h4>Super Mario 64 Advancing</h4><hr>
				<p>Less than a month ago, Joshua Barretto set the GBA and N64 scenes ablaze with news of something we all thought would be impossible: Super Mario 64 was being ported to the Game Boy Advance.
				<p>Since early May, the visuals have gone from a primative red triangle to a rudimentary silver model of the plumber to a bendable, animatable facsimile of the main man himself. The progress is wonderful to behold, and the coder behind it is doing some very impressive work in delivering an instantly recognisable version of the original for the 2001 handheld.
				<p>The gravity of this statement is unimaginable, probably even for Nintendo, who no doubt will want to stomp all over this and DMCA the heck out of it. Hopefully this will fly under their radar and continue undetected.
				<p>The word "Port" implies that Joshua is taking the <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64" target="_blank">decompiled code</a> and recompiling it for GBA, but this doesn't appear to be the case. He is not taking the 64-bit binaries and simply converting them to 32-bit. Rather, there is a lot of custom code, no pre-built engines in use, and what appears to be a lot of trial and error in getting the game to render. Understandably, performing this feat is going to be extremely challenging, and there has to be a heck of a lot of optimisations and specific techniques to get a version anywhere close to the original, so it may be more accurate to consider this a de-make, rather than a port.

				</span></center>
				<h4>Improvement in Movement </h4><hr>
				<p>The latest iteration of this project sees Mario regain some of his distinguishing acrobatics, with flipping, crouching, sliding, and jumping looking extremely recognisable. What's impressive is how the developer is gradually adding features that gave the game its distinctive look and feel, and he's attempting to rebuild every element within the restrictions of the 240 × 160 aperture.
				<p>The Game Boy Advance was limited to just 288 KB RAM and 98 KB VRAM, whereas the N64 has access to 4 MB (or 8 MB for games that were created to take advantage of the Expansion Pak when inserted). The SOC design of the GBA means that onboard was an ARM7TDMI running 16.78 MHz and a Sharp SM83 running 4 / 8 MHz, whereas the N64 housed a dedicated 64-bit NEC VR4300 CPU running at 93.75 MHz, paired with a dedicated SGI RCP GPU running 62.5 MHz. A huge difference in technology, and a vast difference in architecture, all of which would make directly porting a 3D 64-bit home console game to a traditionally 2D 32-bit handheld extremely challenging.
				<p>The fully bespoke approach taken, to effectively recreate the entire game from scratch with only graphic resources to hand and an understanding of how SM64 looks, feels, and plays, will be no doubt tougher, but is already yielding visible results at a lot faster rate than a traditional port would see.</p>
				<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8QWjQ5RLQw"></iframe>
				<p>Hopefully this game will flourish and allow yet another console to enjoy the 1996 platformer, and that's what matters at the core of this: that everyone can enjoy their favourite games any way they like.
				<p>I will be continuing to follow this project as it evolves and will be sure to keep you up to date on any significant updates going forward!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Foslerfer AKA The Perfect Dark Girl. Please, tell us a bit about yourself.</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm here to express my love for Perfect Dark/Zero and archive as much information as I can about the Perfect Dark franchise. I can recognize that my love for the series is maybe a little bit out there. My ultimate goal on the interwebs is to show other folks like me to allow ourselves to be authentic to who we are, regardless of if it can be considered weird or maybe means loving Perfect Dark a bit too much.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I must have been really young when I first started gaming. I'm younger than most people in the retro gaming community, born in 2005. But I was 12 when I started playing Perfect Dark and talking a lot in online forums. My first collection was my current one, sparked by a single Perfect Dark Zero polo shirt, fueled by some awesome encouraging people in the Perfect Dark community.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>All stuff somehow relates to the Perfect Dark series. Copies, Magazines, Clothes, dolls, posters. You name it, I have it with Joanna Dark on it. Oh, and of course; 108 Copies of Perfect Dark Zero.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Hard to say, I love the 64, But I love the Xbox 360 too. If you had a Falcon 2 to my head, I'd have to say 360. Maybe the N64 is just a little before my time. But it is very, very close.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Believe it or not (and this is a shocker) mostly Perfect Dark and Perfect Dark Zero. I play some other games like Grabbed By The Ghoulies, Goldeneye 007. But I spend most of my time on PD. There is always something new to upload to the Data Uplink in my brain.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Probably my Perfect Dark Vinyl record. It's not particularly rare, but it's a really neat thing, gifted to me by a really neat person. Not a whole lot of my stuff is particularly valuable (I maybe spent $600 on everything in total) But it's really sentimental to me, and much of it is gifts from awesome 64 players and PD lovers.</p></div>				
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Perfect Dark Zero recorder pen. There is so little about it out there that it's like it doesn't exist. And I'm still looking for more pictures from the “Meet Joanna Dark” event in 2000. Not a lot of this stuff is well documented, which is why I feel like it's my duty to document whatever I can.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Perfect Dark via N64 Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Foslerfer.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I may not be super up to date with my knowledge when it comes to this sort of thing, but any way to make Perfect Dark easier to play and experience makes me happy. After all, it's projects like N64Recomp that keep the community alive and well!</p></div>

			<h5 class="subtitle">Quality over Quantity ~ June 27, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Features/NoGames/N64Console.png" alt="N64 Stats" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">N64 Game Info</div></div>
				<h4>'The N64 Had No Games'</h4><hr>
				<p>I have heard this a lot throughout the years. People would sound off that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games" target="_blank">SNES had 1,700+ releases</a> and that there were a startling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_(A%E2%80%93L)" target="_blank">4000+ games on Sony's first PlayStation console</a>, but the N64 had "f#&k all." I would typically retort with "What percentage of those SNES/PSX games have you actually played?" and the answer was always very few, perhaps a handful of games, but definitely no where near a significant percentage of the available titles.
				<p>Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Super Nintendo had a lot going for them, particularly RPG games, movie tie-ins, and light guns! During the 90's, they were fierce rivals, with the whole reason the first PlayStation existed being for Sony to spite Nintendo after the sourness of their illfated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_NES_CD-ROM" target="_blank">SNES-CD</a> partnership.
				<p>Rivalry is a good thing in the industry because it nurtures progression, innovation, and most importantly, variety. But back then, obtaining 1000+ games was impossible for most people, and within each console's respective catalogue was undoubtedly a percentage of dud titles. The bigger the catalogue, the higher number of games that small percentage represents.
				<p>With the N64, Nintendo utilised their "seal of quality" to best effect, ensuring endless torrents of sub-quality games didn't show up on their platform and thus the number of games quickly dimished. That, plus Ninetndo 64's cartridge-based approached to distribution as opposed to CD, meant smaller or more optimised games and higher development and manufacture costs. 
				<p>If you wanted your game on a Nintendo, it had to be good! There were even games like Resident Evil 2 that is today deemed the impossible port, because of the incredible amount of optimisation and skill it took to whittle down 2 CD's worth of data (757 MB to be precise) into a tiny 64 MB cart.
				<h4>Disecting the N64 Catalogue</h4><hr>
				<p>As a collector, I like to know how many games it takes to complete my collections, so I recently broke this down and discovered that of the N64's 388 individual titles, within that you have (roughly) 83 Sports titles, 65 Racing, 49 Action, 36 Fighting, 25 Platform, 20 Simulation, 18 Shoot 'em up, 16 Adventure, 16 First-Person Shooter, 14 Puzzle, 14 Board Games, 
				9 Strategy, 8 Party, 3 Card-based, 1 Rhythm, and a couple more miscellaneous ones that slip through an indescript net. I have classed these fairly loosely because there are arguments for and against calling the <i>Zelda</i> games RPGs or action-adventure games, and while both are true, which is really the most accurate categorisation? You could probably cantankerously argue that you're role-playing as Wayne Gretzky, Superman, or even Star Fox in their titular games.
				<p>You could even get more granular and sub-categorise sports games, for example, into ice hockey, soccer, fishing (OOT also had fishing in it), and so on, but for the purposes of keeping it simple and easier to follow, I have kept the genre split to a minimum with games falling into their most approximate categories.
				<p>I wanted to visualise this data and see what proportion of the N64's catalogue made up those categories, so I crafted a crude chart. As you can see below, the N64 was actually a sports-heavy console with racing and action-based games at the forefront, regardless of it being synonymous with some of the best FPS games ever made:
				</p>
				<center><div id="myChart" style="width:95%; max-width:500px; height:500px;overflow: hidden;"></div></center>
				<script>
				google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
				google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
				function drawChart() {
				const data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
				  ['Genre', 'Number'],
				  ['Sports',83],
				  ['Racing',65],
				  ['Action',49],
				  ['Fighting',36],
				  ['Platform',25],
				  ['Simulation',20],
				  ['Shoot em up',18],
				  ['FPS',16],
				  ['Adventure',16],
				  ['Puzzle',14],
				  ['Board game',14],
				  ['Strategy',9],
				  ['Party',8],
				  ['Misc',5]
				]);
				const options = {
				  title:'Genre Breakdown',
				  is3D: true,
				  responsive: true,
				  maintainAspectRatio: true,
				};
				const chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('myChart'));
				chart.draw(data, options);
				}
				</script>
				<h4>Vital Statistics:</h4><hr>
				<p>While the N64 had less than 400 games to its name, of those titles, which ones stood out? Well, though most "top 10s" almost always site adventure and platforming games for the majority, there is notably only one sports title in the feature: <i>Mario Tennis</i>.
				<p>This seems to indicate that though the N64 was saturated with over one fifth of its titles being sports games, they were rarely impactful or console sellers. The N64 has had a reputation for having mainly first-person shooters on it, but the reality is that under 5% of its catalogue is actually comprised of FPS titles, and of those 16 games, 2 of them hold the second and third spots in the N64's all-time top ten on Metacritic, a site that aggregates thousands of reviews per-game.
				<ol>
					<li>The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time <span class="badge score"><i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> 99%</span>

				</ol>
				<p>I think that the majority of the N64's preconceptions spring from the fact it had 4-player support, and as such, experiencing multiplayer FPS games in front of one single TV screen was unheard of in the late 90s. A lot of people have shared memoires of playing the likes of <i>Turok 2, Rage Wars</i>, and even <i>Duke Nukem 64</i> in the luxury of their homes with three mates huddled around a screen. Those days were massively impactful formative memories of a relatively fledgling gaming environment where more than two players competing together was brand new.
				<p>RARE notably stepped up and excelled with the N64 hardware, exclusively bringing us not one but two solid first-person shooter titles that every other console manufacturer at the time would be jealous of, for years to come.
				<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> and its spiritual ancestor, <i>GoldenEye 007</i>, are two of the most incredible FPS games ever made, transcending the N64's end of life in 2002 and still being talked about in 2024!</p>

				<h4>False Negatives:</h4><hr>
				<p>With the games listed above still being referenced today, the N64 is perhaps a misunderstood console. It could also stand as one that people possibly missed out on during the late '90s, and as a result they either had a PS1 or held on to their SNES until they eventually graduated to the PS2, DC, and GameCube era.
				<p><i>Ocarina of Time</i> is widely acclaimed as the best game ever made. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was a pivotal release in demonstrating and redefining the analog stick and showing off innovative 3D platforming. <i>GoldenEye 007</i> redefined and pioneered the modern FPS, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> raised the bar 007 set, and is still revered as a masterpiece. I'm not saying that the PS1 didn't have highly rated games; I'm just pointing out the ratio of quality vs quantity that Nintendo's "seal of quality" stood for back then.
				<p>In <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" target="_blank">Metacritic's</a> top-rated games of all time, <i>OOT, GE 007</i>, and <i>Perfect Dark</i> solidly hold three of the top 20 spots, while the nearest PS1 entry sits at number 23 with <i>Tekken 3</i>. Personally, I love the Tekken series of games, so I fully appreciate <i>Tekken 3</i>'s longevity in the charts.
				<p>It's great to see that the N64, a console that purportedly "had no games", still holds its own in 2024.
				<p>Personally, I can recommend a whole slew of games for the system, the majority of which were N64 exclusive up until very recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/NightdiveStudio" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios</a> have done a stellar job in bringing N64 gems, such as the <i>Turok trilogy, Shadow Man</i>, and <i>Doom 64</i>, to the modern consoles. I recently completed all of those on my PS5, and I have to say it was the perfect blend of enhanced graphics, rejuvinated controls, and pure nostalgia; highly recommended!
				<p><i>Diddy Kong Racing, Rocket Robot on Wheels, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Space Station Silicon Valley, Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness</i>, and <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> to begin with are all worthy of your attention, even today.
				<p>(Note: DK64 & Ogre Battle haven't been available since Wii U VC.)</p>

				</span>
				</center>
				<p>None of the above games are available on recent platforms, probably due to licensing restrictions, but regardless, they are N64 exclusives that are still definitely worth a look today.
				<p><a href="blog.html#b3">N64Recomp</a> should pave the way to enjoy these games on PC again, with better framerates and upscaled resolutions. Their style, playability, and originality are through the roof, so I cannot wait to get stuck back in!
				<p>Hopefully this will set the topic to rest, and allow people to enjoy the games they want to, however they want. Emulation, ports and OG hardware are all fine by me!

			<h4>A Ripping Good Time</h4><hr>
			<p>As a collector of variants, I want to know that I'm getting a legit game and that I will have the freedom to dump, preserve, examine, modify, and emulate them should I wish to.
			<p>The JoeyN64 by BennVenn is a device that I have had in my arsenal for a while. It's operation is so simple that all you have to do is connect a USB-C cable to your PC and drag and drop the ROM off of an N64 cartridge to back it up.
			<p>If you want to play your backups in an emulator, or on another flash cart, just dump them in a ROMs folder and away you go. Want to play through <a href="https://www.pj64-emu.com/" target="_blank">Project64</a>? Simply connect the JoeyN64 to your PC, load up PJ64, and select the ROM from the cartridge once the drive pops up. In order to use your saves with the cart, copy them off first and put them in the PJ64 saves folder.
			<p>At the time of writing, the JoeyN64 is $55 AUD (£29) from BennVenn's Shopify store, and it is supported by a discord group where the other main feature is a very lively chat: the ability to reflash repro carts!
			<p>Reflashing clone carts means that if you were to be in posession of a Smash Remix cart, you could simply update it at any time by dragging and dropping a more recent version ROM onto the cart, overwriting the previous version. 
			<p>The only issues you may face are those of the CIC regioning, and as such, you must flash a compatible ROM to the installed hardware CIC, or you can try to convert the ROM.
			<p>JoeyN64 main features:
			<ul>
				<li>Fast, easy, reliable access to all your N64 ROM's and Save files - EEPROM (4/16K), Flash (All types), SRAM, Memory Pak.
				<li>Supports reflashing the latest chinese bootleg N64 games. 
				<li>Supports reading/writing save files from these Chinese carts where other N64 cart dumpers cannot. 
				<li>Drag and Drop ROMs to write to the cart.
				<li>Enjoy some of the best ROM hacks and remakes on real hardware! 
				<li>You cannot rewrite original Nintendo carts.
				<li>Can detect if a cart is fake or genuine. (Connect to a smartphone for easy cart identification when you're out hunting for games).
				<li>Supports N64 and Z64 ROM's, can automatically byteswap (Write in mode.txt which file format you prefer).
				<li>Can load directly from cart into Project64 emulator.
				<li>Drag and Drop Firmware updates over USB-C
				<li>New firmware files will be available as we discover new Chinese bootleg types
				<li>~750kbytes/second dump speed, ~310kbytes/second flash speed.
				<li>Official N64 Dev Carts NOT supported without external 12 volt supply modification.
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>Easy to Upgrade, Easy to use!</h4><hr>
			<p>I recently used my JoeyN64 to dump some Taiwanese and Malaysian cartridges, and it took mere seconds to achieve this. Inserting the cartridge, and dragging the ROM off is incredibly intuitive, and it's so quick in comparison to older, less stable methods of dumping with a Game Shark and parallel a port!
			<p>Updating the JoeyN64 to the latest firmware is as simple as plugging it into your PC, dragging across the "mode.txt" file first, and then dragging the "firmware.jr" file afterwards. The "mode.txt" file is editable in several ways, and for flashing an update it must have the word "UPDATE" in the first line. After this you can change the modes as you wish:
			<ul>
				<li>PAK - Access Controller Pak saves (controller port)
				<li>FCE0-FCE4 - erase sectors of the flashcart
				<li>FCE or NOERASE - if the cart cannot be read/written to
				<li>UPDATE - update Firmware
				<li>N64 - Set file format to N64 
				<li>Z64 - Set file format to Z64 (Byteswapped)
				<li>BANK0 - First 64mbytes of MultiCart access (Z64 Format)
				<li>BANK1 - Second 64mbytes of MultiCart access (Z64 format) 
			</ul>
			<p>Changing modes is as easy as editing the txt file, which is simple, but it feels a little clunky, and what if you have it on the wrong mode? Thankfully the JoeyN64 is pretty smart for the most part, and I haven't experienced any issues using mine to dump or reflash repros.
			<p>As alluded to above, there are software CIC commands (softCIC) you can use too, such as "61052" for converting a 6105 ROM to run on a 6102 cartridge. It's by no means foolproof and more often than not, it won't work due to compatibility of the CIC in your repro hardware. Luckily there is a fantastic flashing guide and reference by Gent over on his <a href="https://github.com/TheGent/Gents-N64-xdelta-Patches/blob/main/Gent's%20Joey64%20Clone%20Cart%20-%20CIC%20%26%20Save%20Type%20Guide.md2" target="_blank">github page</a> that untangles softCIC quandries, and <a href="https://bennvenn.myshopify.com/pages/n64-bootleg-carts" target="_blank">BennVenns Bootleg Guide</a> lets you see which repro carts are the most compatible for flashing ROMs to.
			<p>There are <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools.htm" target="_blank">other resources too</a>, such as <a href="http://micro-64.com/database/patches/S-Paladin.zip" target="_blank">Paladin</a> or <a href="http://n64.icequake.net/mirror/64scener.parodius.com/tools/obs-mot3.zip" target="_blank">MotetIII</a>, that can convert the CIC and <a href="https://github.com/StarHack/n64reflashing" target="_blank">patch the CRC</a> to run again.
			<p>The ability to copy saves from the cartridge or dump them from the Memory Pak, also opens up the possibility to use modded saves, because not only are they readable, they're writable too!
			<p>An upcoming feature for the firmware includes 900k/sec transfer speed, which is over twice that of the current JoeyN64 MCU speed. This will make dumping and flashing so much quicker than it already is, and I for one will be updating the second it becomes available. Another upcoming piece of software, that BennVenn has hinted at is a GUI for these tools, which will begin with the Joey JR GBA flasher/dumper and will eventually make it to the JoeyN64 someday. This could be incredibly useful and would negate the need to manually edit a txt file each time you want to swap modes.
			<p>The JoeyN64 is a dream come true for verification and backing up ROMs as a collector, but also as a reflashing tool for hobbyists. The one downside to the JoeyN64 is that it cannot dump development carts, the tombstone-like prototype cartridges we see people finding in random places that miraculously contain a fully playable build of <a href="https://n64squid.com/rev-limit-unreleased-n64-game/" target="_blank">Rev Limit</a>, for example.

			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Incredibly easy to use<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Compatible with PJ64 plug-and-play<br>

			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>I'm a huge fan of this device because this is the perfect way to verify, dump, and preserve your own ROMs with zero fuss and minimal effort. You can even drill into the other available features to do a heck of a lot more if you need to. Overall it is effortless to use and well supported through the discord channel, and I cannot wait to see what updates and features come next!

			<h5 class="subtitle">Joanna and Joshua show up! ~ Jun 19, 2024</h5>
				<div class="bgBanner" style="background: rgba(231,0,18,255)"><img src="Blog/Features/NSOJune24/NSO.png" alt="NSO N64" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">N64 on NSO</div></div>
				<h4>N64 Expansion Pak Line Up:</h4><hr>
				<p>It's a shocking statistic; less than 10% of the N64 catalogue is represented <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-64-nintendo-switch-online-switch/" target="_blank">officially on Nintendo's NSO online platform</a>. This week <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> join the ranks of replayable games, but how do they fare?
				<p>To date, there are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Switch_Online_games" target="_blank">36 N64 games</a>, out of a possible 388, on Nintendo Switch Online's N64 Expansion Pak service. Japan has <i>Custom Robo</i> and <i>Custom Robo V2</i> as exclusives, while the USA and EUR regions have <i>Dr. Mario, Iggy's Reckin' Balls, Pokemon Puzzle League</i>, and <i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> as their exclusives. 
				<p>Notably, <i>Sin & Punishment</i>, a Japanese exclusive, has had USA box art added for its English language release that's exclusive to NSO, even though no such physical copy exists other than in bootleg form.
				<p>Nintendo is drip-feeding games across NSO at such a slow rate, that I'm beginning to doubt that the Nintendo Switch will ever see Donkey Kong 64, or Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber, as the Wii U did (though there are at least two slots still remaining in the NSO N64 database).
				<p>Licensing issues aside, I feel that Nintendo is trying to get away with doing as little as possible when it comes to truly offering and preserving the games in a way that people can replay them faithfully, as they were intended to be experienced.
				<center>
				<img width="98%" src="Blog/Features/NSOJune24/NSO2.jpg" />
				</center>
				<p>Nintendo is the keeper of the games, and also the ones DMCA'ing anyone who attempts to enjoy games that aren't even on their shaky platform. Why is N64 emulation on NSO so broken, and why is it acceptable for them to leave it in such a state?
				<p>The internal name for the N64 emulator is "Hovercraft" and it is based on the Wii U N64 emulator developed by Nintendo and iQue. It is used as a blanket emulator, in tandem with LUA config files, to operate with every ROM. While the emulator does bring a few features such as JIT real-time code compilation, RPT for texture replacement, and online multiplayer, it also brings a lot of game-breaking bugs thanks to this blanket approach and no game specific optimisations. Rather, they use LUA to bodge the games into running on an all-for-one emulator. 
				<p>How on Earth does this even pass QA??
				<p>Nintendo has seen fit to included suspend points, upped resolutions, and enhanced frame rates to play these games, though all we see is broken or missing effects, performance issues across the catalogue of games, and horrible input lag. That's not to mention a complete lack of a proper remapping function for the Joy-Cons or the N64 controller. The way the buttons are laid out, or worse, the requirement for you to switch configurations on the fly on a Joy-Con, is heartbreaking.</p>

				<h4>New Entries, New Problems</h4><hr>
				<p>It's incredible to think that Nintendo could mess up their own platform for playing games that are otherwise unavailable to play elsewhere (unless you own the carts). Somehow, they have taken a console so beloved by so many, and churned out crappily emulated versions of our favourite games almost every time.
				<p><i>Perfect Dark</i> is something we have dreamed of for a long time, with a solid story mode, cooperative, and now online multiplayer. But yet somehow this version, the version you pay your hard earned money for, is borked upon release.
				<p>For starters, the game chugs in a way that it NEVER did on OG hardware, there are sounds, effects, and textures rendering incorrectly, hiddeous input lag, poor analog controls, and to top it off, the controller bindings are useless: even with the BlueTooth N64 Controller.
				<p><i>Turok Dinosaur Hunter</i> also suffers from heinous input mapping, missing screen effects, and memory Pak pop-ups that should have been patched out at very least. It's a poor showing for a game that revolutionised FPS games in 1997, that it can't be replayed seamlessly in 2024. 
				<p>Looking back at the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> release in January 2023, it was the same story. It still has not been rectified to make the game less janky to play and fix various issues that the N64 never presented. There was one patch released in August 2023 that addressed some texture and framerate issues, though it only served to exacerbate sound quality issues, and still has yet to be fully fixed.
				<p>Fundamentally, the methods deployed are sub-par at their core. Nintendo needs to up their game in the 64-bit emulation stakes, and rather than giving us half-assed emulation, give us guns blazing, cycle accurate playability with the option to enhance frame rates and resolutions, and the ability to correctly display all in-game effects across all games. A little care and attention would go a long way, and they could learn a huge amount from the <a href="blog.html#b3" target="_blank">N64Recomp</a> project!
				<p>Heck, 64DD emulation wouldn't go amiss either. We have known it's existence since the Wii U and 64DD games havn't ever been added to any Nintendo storefront.

			<h4>A Mini Steering Controller</h4><hr>
			<p>I don't know why, but I've wanted one of these for a very long time. I think it's a mixture of morbid curiosity and a penchant for the weird and wonderful in the world of N64 controllers!
			<p>The Performance UltraRacer 64 is unlike anything you've probably seen before, with a singular handle to hold onto and a small foam encircled wheel mounted on the top. The wheel acts as the analog stick twisting left and right to steer, and it houses the four C-buttons at the summit of its form. The remainder of the buttons are sprinkled upon the top of the handle, in thumbs reach, but oddly, even they aren't as they seem. The cluster of blue and green buttons are NOT A or B buttons, instead, they are L/Z/R buttons with a bonus "Extra" green button as the fourth.
			<p>Underneath the handle is not a Z-trigger, it's the A and B buttons but in the form of a strange two-way-trigger; clicking upward for B, and clicking downward for A. This trigger also acts as the up and down analog stick controls. On the right hand side is a switch, and this one turns the A and B buttons on and off, and remaps them to the D-Pad left and right buttons. It's like Performance said, "Take every feature and turn it on its head", because not much on this controller makes sense.
			<p>The D-Pad buttons are just beneath the position of the main wheel, and again, in what I would consider odd order; Up, Down, Left, Right. I perhaps would have positioned them; Left, Up, Down, Right so that the cardinal directions matched up more with the edges of the controller, for ease of use? Towards the bottom of the prong are the Start and Set buttons, the latter of which can be used to programme 14 out of the 16 buttons on the controller, so you could completely remap it if you were so inclined!
			<p>Programming the buttons is simple: hold the Set button until it beeps, tap the button you want to change, followed by the button you want it to become. The pad beeps when beginning and again upon completion to indicate a successful programming. Reverting the pad back to default is achieved by holding A+L+R for several seconds upon turning the console on with it plugged in.
			<p>The wheel, is a very strange creature. It measures 2-inches across and fits nicely between your fingers with its squishy, foam-rubber surround. It turns just 45° clockwise and 45° anticlockwise, so it has a tight, responsive feel to it, but, and this is a big but: its responsiveness is questionable.

			<h4>Small Wheel Energy</h4><hr>
			<p>In order to test out this racing-centric controller, I chose the original racers on the console: <i>Mario Kart 64, Wave Race 64, F-Zero X</i>, and, for good measure, <i>World Driver Championship</i>.
			<p>For <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, <i>F-Zero X</i>, and <i>World Driver Championship</i> the UltraRacer 64 fared well overall. Steering around corners and navigating tracks feels good, but the buttons feel slightly off all around the controller. In any game menus, character or vehicle select, it's recommended to slide the A/B switch off so that you can use the D-Pad left and right buttons as the A and B buttons. Once the game commences you switch the slider back to the on position.
			<p><i>Wave Race 64</i> was pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to control. It was like skating on ice, the turning circle was almost nonexistent, and the characters glided effortlessly out of bounds when attempting to round any corner.
			<p>The biggest issue I had with this controller was the A/B slider/trigger controlling the analog Y-axis. I genuinely don't understand the design choices made to get this pad to function. It's so specific in its design towards racing games that it feels like Performance then tacked the rest of the features they omitted back on, through any bizarre way possible. 
			<p>Overall, the UltraRacer 64 has its merits for driving games specifically, but beyond that, it's purely chock full of gimmicks that sadly won't make this an essential purchase unless you are mad on racing games 24/7.
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Completely remappable<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Good, but exclusively for driving games</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Awful analog controls<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Questionable design</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>The UltraRacer 64 is yet another oddity from the N64 era that now serves as a talking point collectable rather than a controller that you would choose to ever replace your OG trident. It's niche means that you should only reach for it when strictly playing car-based racing games.

				<h4>Recomp Fast, Decomp Slow</h4><hr>
				<p>Mr-Wiseguy's N64Recomp project came to light at the beginning of May, bursting out the gates with a promise of statically recompiling N64 binaries into C code for use on other platforms. With one demonstration provided; <i>The Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask</i> has seen an incredible resurgence in the last 4 weeks, with virtually everyone I know enjoying the game at 60fps, with gyro aiming, in wide/ultrawide screen, and with a rejuvenated analog camera system.
				<p>The way the <i>Majoras Mask</i> port was built using the <a href="https://github.com/rt64/rt64" target="_blank">RT64 graphic renderer</a>, means modern APIs such as Vulkan, can be deployed for maximum compatibility across more platforms and with massive resolutions compared to N64's native 320×240, or 640×480 with an Expansion Pak.
				<p>Recompilation aims to immediately recompile binaries without the need for lengthy (upwards of years) decompilation beforehand, followed by months of porting to other platforms via their respective SDKs. Some decompilation projects have been running for years, with only <i><a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64" target="_blank">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zeldaret/oot" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Erick194/DOOM64-RE" target="_blank">Doom 64</a>, <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/perfect_dark" target="_blank">Perfect Dark</a></i>, and most recently, <i><a href="https://github.com/pmret/papermario" target="_blank">Paper Mario</a></i> taking the limelight. The problem with decompilation is that to get a perfect one-to-one replica of a game's source code takes a long time because each function, instruction, and opcode needs mapping out and verifying at multiple stages to ensure correctness.
				<p>I have been following the majority of these decompilation projects for a long time, most since inception, but the progress is a long and arduous one, and not one that most game-enjoyers can commit to, even if they REALLY want to see their favourite games get a fancy new up-rezzed PC port. It's usually left to those in the know, but with N64Recomp; it could become very convenient for anyone to run any game.
				<p>By incorporating tools such as Rabbitizer, which is a MIPs decoder that can convert ASM (machine code) to C, ELFIO, TOML11 and FMTLIB, then directly piping it all to RT64; you will have the ability to easily build your own ROMs into playable PC ports in minutes.
				<p>At least, that's the aim, because currently, without Mr-Wiseguy's tools being made public yet, it takes even the most well versed in coding a couple of hours to get their head around the process of linking and building, let alone fixing errors and residual problems, such as game specific microcode, you will undoubtedly face when starting each game from scratch.</p>

				<h4>What's in the Pipeline?</h4><hr>
				<p>With incredible features such as ray tracing and HD texture support coming to the RT64 engine, N64 ports could look like fresh games, and with <i>Banjo Kazooie, Rocket: Robot on Wheels</i>, and <i>Superman 64</i> being immediately worked on by Mr-Wiseguy, the future of N64 gaming is very bright!
				<p>The ability to recompile our own games is a feature I'm massively looking forward to. <i>Wave Race 64, Lylat Wars, Diddy Kong Racing</i>, and <i>Conkers Bad Fur Day</i>, to name but a few! Can you imagine <i>Wave Race 64</i> with Ray Tracing?! There are so many gems in the N64 library that could benefit from just the enhanced framerates and increased resolutions, that I'm extremely excited to get my hands on the toolset when they drop.
				<p>Thankfully, as mentioned before, Mr-Wiseguy is in the process of building tools that can load, translate, and read any N64 ROM for recompilation in next to no time. Extra touches like modern controller mapping, gyro support, increased FPS, and widescreen culling will come as configuration files and executable revisions, because each game needs individual care and attention to port features to offsets, but the overall time reduction, compared to standard decompilation, is astounding. As an example; <i>Majoras Mask</i> was recompiled to a playable state with RT64 upgrades and full console-accurate effects in under 2 days!
				<p>If any of this still sounds like too much work, then rest assured that others will jump at the opportunity to provide the final executables we need to play the games, we will just have to shove a ROM into a directory, the same way the <i>Majoras Mask</i> works right now.
				<p>You may be asking yourself if N64Recomp will make emulators redundant; I don't think so. Emulation is a more universal approach to faithfully, and cycle-accurately, play ROMs, but N64Recomp adds a lot more by way of modernising the games with features that emulators don't currently offer if you have the time and inclination to put into it. Emulators, because of their maturity, are instantly more compatible, and are way more convenient for the end user across a variety of platforms. This may change depending on N64Recomp advancements, but that remains to be seen at the time of writing.
				<p>I do wonder though: can these principals be used to recompile games from other systems, such as 3DS or GameCube? 
				<p>I hope we might find out in the not-so-distant future!

			<h5 class="subtitle">InterAct Vortex ~ June 13, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/InterActVortex/Vortex.png" alt="Vortex" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">InterAct Vortex</div></div>
			<h4>Far From Plane, Wheely Weird</h4><hr>
			<p>Let me guess; you just looked at the banner image and said to yourself, "What the $&%# is that thing?!". I did too when I first saw the InterAct Vortex controller for N64, but it didn't stop my hunting one down and bagging one, for the insanely low price of just £10!
			<p>The Vortex is an enigma, even to those who know about it. It's half steering wheel, half flight stick, and half controller, making it 150% insane. Starting with the controller aspect, you have to un-dock the controller portion from the mounting bracket via a square metal peg, and once you have just the controller in your hands, you will be quite disgusted at its chunky, unflattering and un-ergonomic form.
			<p>It is quite literally horrible to hold, and to make things worse, its vastness and unwieldy edges make it uncomfortable to grab on to for long periods of time. The button placement is good, and the shoulder buttons are there, but where is the Z-Trigger and the actual analog stick? Well, I'll get to those gripes later. The whole thing feels plasticy, it has squared-off sides, and it's far too burly to grip. It reminds me of the OG Xbox controller, the Duke, it's far too big, but at least the Duke had comfortable curves.
			<p>Connecting it back to its mount you get an idea for its steering pedigree. While the mount has ZERO buttons or functions, the square metal peg pushes into the back of the controller, and the device regains its analog abilities. The switch on the front right controls the analog modes, and you have the option to use it as a wheel or as a flight stick, the latter meaning if you tilt the whole thing towards you or away from you, you will rise or fall, just like a plane's yoke. Back in the 1990s this must have seemed so space-age, but today it's a stark reminder of how NOT to make a hybrid controller, I mean; how many things like this have you seen for modern consoles?</p>

			<h4>It's no Yoke: It's Bad!</h4><hr>
			<p>The Vortex is a jack of all trades but the master of none. Not one. It offers so much and looks fantastically "90s-modern", but it squanders its potential in every direction.
			<p>Using the controller, most games control ok, but you're missing the analog stick and an L/R or Z-trigger depending on what position the switch on the bottom left is set to. Not to worry because the J button acts as a surrogate for whichever button you misplace, but that button is rock solid.
			<p>To give it a varied test I fired up <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i>, <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, and <i>Hexen</i> using the three available setups. <i>Mario Kart 64</i> admittedly controlled well in steering mode, and using the toggle on the top right I could adjust sensitivity on the V-Axis. <i>Knife Edge</i> was a mixed bag, with the sensitivity and inversion throwing me right off, however, in-game you can alter the settings to make it far more controllable and enjoyable.
			<p><i>Hexen</i>, on the other hand, was hilarious to essentially drive around, with flight controls. Pushing forward moves the analog stick forward to walk, while tilting to the left or right turns the protagonist, so for a hot minute it was quite fun! The auto-fire and slow-motion buttons worked fine; however, I found that the "Direction Control Knob", or D-Pad, was very quick to rapidly fire off when even so much as slightly held down in any direction, and I could not seem to turn that off or prevent it from happening.
			<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Vortex also features its very own rumble mechanism, which requires 2xAA batteries inserted into the rear. It has a small switch on the back of the pad to select rumble mode or save mode, though why it can't rumble whilst saving to a memory card in the slot is beyond me. Another swing, and another miss!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Q&A Toadfan5!</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Thank you! I'm always happy to talk about games since they're such an important part of my life.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Lets begin this Q&A by telling people how you would describe your presence on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>So I think a lot of the retro content being created has been focused too much on the NES and SNES, and while those consoles are excellent, I think the N64 has a lot to offer that people just genuinely don't know about. So I'd like to tell people of all the great N64 games that have gone overlooked for too long.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually been playing games since I was about 3 or 4 years old. I found my sister's original Game Boy and played Super Mario Land 2 a Power Rangers game and a Barbie game (I also lost Mario Land 2 by dropping it through some floorboards) My first home console though was the N64 that I got from my grandparents for Christmas in 1998 with Yoshi's Story and NASCAR 99.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My retro collection is most filled with just the games I really like or that seem worth playing. Except for the N64 collection which is the 296 north American releases and around 40 of the Japanese exclusives, and one European exclusive...and one game that went everywhere except north America. Funny enough the console I have the most games for besides the N64 is actually the Xbox 360 which is definitely my second favorite console.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Speaking of favorites yeah of course the N64 is my favorite console. I have such good memories of it throughout so many different parts of my life. To round out my top 5 though I'd have to go Xbox 360, Dreamcast, SNES, and GameCube.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually really been back into GTA 5, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, Donkey Kong 64, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Rock Band 4.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I've actually got an autographed copy of Diddy Kong Racing DS that I won from an old Banjo Kazooie fan site called Roysten's Fishbowl! That and I got a custom Mario themed N64 that I've used practically everyday since 2015.</p></div>				
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The N64 DD. I've wanted one since I heard about it in Nintendo Power back in like 1999. I feel like most of the games are possible to obtain someday (minus Japan Pro Golf Tour 64 and Doshin 2) but I want the actual add on so badly.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to any games via N64Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>If it gets more people playing more games I'm fine for any of 'em. If I had to pick one game to get the decompilation treatment though it would be Bomberman 64 the Second Attack (easily the most underrated and overlooked N64 game)</p></div>

				<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">

				<p>How many games consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Alright I own: NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Wii, Switch, Switch lite, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, GBA, GBAsp, DS, DS lite, 3DS, 2DS, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PSP, PlayStationTV, Xbox, Xbox 360 (with Kinect), Xbox One, Genesis, Saturn, and a Dreamcast 🙂</p></div>

				<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut, and it was 325. I've also got Bangai O and Getter Love but those were around 150 each.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled up for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Toadfan5.jpg" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Oh man my favorite drink right now is a mix of Melon Soda and Root Beer, it's just such a perfect mix. Other than that I drink mostly water and Decaf Earl Gray tea when it's cold. Food wise I love cola and melon soda gummies, and some mozzarella sticks.</p></div>

			<h5 class="subtitle">InterAct Racing Wheel V3 ~ June 8, 2024</h5>
			<div class="bgBanner"><img src="Blog/Reviews/InterActV3Wheel/IV3W.png" alt="V3Wheel" class="center"/><div class="overlaytext">InterAct V3 Wheel</div></div>
			<h4>Steering the Conversation</h4><hr>
			<p>I picked this wheel up a few years ago because I intended to craft a small, cheap as chips racing set up in my living room. I wanted to be able to re-play the <i>Top Gear Rally</i> series of games as well as <i>World Driver Championship</i> and of course <i>Mario Kart 64</i>!
			<p>The V3 feels great, even if the wheel feels a little small, though that works to its benefit by feeling tight and compact. The face buttons do a great job of 
			The wheel has two lock switches to configure the wheel in two adjustable ways. The first is the tilt of the wheel, which has two spots: 45 degrees and straight up like a forklift driver. The second lock switch controls the height of the wheel, which is a blindingly good feature to have depending on how you approach using the wheel.
			<p>You can either mount the wheel on a surface via four suction cups, or you can raise the wheel to max and plant it between your thighs like a novelty go-cart!
			The main mechanism is spring-loaded on each side of the wheels axle meaning it feels like it's pulling you back and automatically re-centres itself when you ease off.
			<p>It is possible to completely modify all aspects of this input peripheral thanks to a nifty on-board programmable button. For example, if you hold the "Set" button for two seconds you enter function mode, and from there you can either remap any buttons you like to any other button you like, or you can adjust the sensitivity of the Y-axis steering between 30/90 & 150 degrees. Setting it to 150 degrees means turning the wheel a lot, whereas setting it to just 30 degrees means quicker turning with less effort. For fine tuning, you also have a small red slider on the left of the wheel that can adjust it tighter or looser on-the-fly.
			But if you hate it all and want to reset the wheel you can do so by holding Start+L+R at any point and you're back to default in a jiffy.
			<p>The V3 comes with a set of pedals too, and these are also springloaded. They feel great, they have a nice tension and a satisfying returning action to them that feels great. They plug in to a rather weak looking DIN socket on the rear of the wheel, but both the pedals and the wheel come with 8 feet of cable to give you plenty of room to manoeuvre.</p>

			<h4>Whats the Deal?</h4><hr>
			<p>The first batch of V3 wheels was not compatible with the Rumble pak, but a second batch was produced, and by the end of 1997 everyone was treated to force feedback. Luckily mine rumbles, however if I insert any sort of third-party rumble pack the controller completely stops working, and I have to remove it before it comes back to life. I'm unsure why it does that, and it's rather ironic given the third party nature of the wheel itself, but thems the breaks!
			<p>I'm quite a fan of this wheel because it has so many features and so many comfort settings, but it gets really creaky after a short period of time because of the full plastic construction. The buttons feel great, not spongy at all, and overall it has a nice quality to it that you rarely see from third-party peripherals.
			<p>Would I have paid $79.99/£65 for this back in the day? I probably would have if I hadn't been just a child with no income of my own in the 90's. There was zero chance my parents would have sprung for this for me either, as I wasn't into realistic racing games as a kid, and if I hadn't used the wheel, it would have been money down the drain that could have been better spent on another game for the entire family to play!

His favourites on N64 were GoldenEye, Donkey Kong 64 and Star Wars Racer. I've been involved with gaming since I have use of memory. My mom introduced me into PC's and that eventually lead into gaming there as well. It wasn't until the Xbox 360 that I got into online gaming however, Halo 3 was my first Xbox Live title back in January 2008 and that was a life changing moment which starting my online presence.</p></div>

				<p>Outside of my YouTube work which includes playing GoldenEye, Perfect Dark and other Bond titles, I focus on multiplayer games mainly. These days I'm mostly just hopping between Fortnite, Counter-Strike and an indie game called Friends vs Friends - but in general I play a huge variety of titles. Metroid, Tekken, Resident Evil, Zelda... But I'm definitely more of a competitive player, I've had some good competitions, tournaments and leagues on my back by now.</p></div>

				<h4>Whats New With You?</h4><hr>
				<p>As part of my ongoing N64 collection, I have recently purchased the SummerCart64, created by Mateusz Faderewski (aka Korgeaux), a brand new flashcart that not only plays your N64 ROMs and homebrew, but also plays 64DD ROMs without the need for conversion!</p>
				<p>Krikkz EverDrive 64 X7 has been my go-to for a while now, since I upgraded just after it was released in 2019, and before that I happily used the EverDrive 64 2.5 without issue. SummerCart64 stands on the shoulders of giants and takes multiple strides forward, building on everything that's great about the EverDrive series of carts and adds in features such as native 64DD emulation and heaps of developer forward features.
				<p>It should be noted that the SummerCart64 I bought was from Phemon Mod, meaning the casing is the version sold by Mena. Each store and supplier has their own build quality as it is assembled by a third-party, but the SummerCart64 hardware was designed by Korgeaux, and the N64FlashcartMenu software was developed by Korgeaux and Networkfusion (Robin Jones), as well as multiple other contributors, including Meeq (Christopher Bonhage) and Suprapote!.</p>

				<p>Some people will argue that clones are better value, and easier to get hold of. I have never bothered with knock-off devices because though they get the job done, they always seem to have some form of hiccup when it comes to durabilty and software support. I know plenty of people that have purchased a cheaper clone only to have it fail or quite literally fall to pieces just months down the line. This £120 pre-built model is extremely convenient, though for much less the unit is entirely self-buildable, 3D printable, and flashable!
				<p>The build quality of this Mena built SummerCart64 feels really nice; it uses a sleek plastic finish on its smoky grey exterior that feels wonderful even though it doesn't have the tactile texturing of the OEM carts. The cut-outs for the Micro SD card and the USB-C connector are recessed nicely (note: the SD card slot is miniscule and difficult to remove once inserted), and the hex bolt screws are a nice solid touch to hold it all together.
				<p>The first thing I noticed about the SummerCart64 shell is that there is a somewhat gangly button on the rear that clunks around a bit, it really needed to be spring-loaded, or just less rattly, to push it up even higher in the build-quality stakes buy the assembler, in this case Mena. This button can be configured to change 64DD disks, sending USB packets, or raising N64 interrupts for devs.
				<h4>SummerCart64 Features:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>High N64 ROM compatibility (Morita Shogi 64 & Mario no Photopi hardware not supported yet)
					<li>64DD hardware emulation: loads 64DD disks (+ ROM combo/multi Disk)

					<li>Auto writeback after ~1s to the Micro SD/USB
					<li>N64 ROM box image support<li>Music playback (MP3)<li>Background image (PNG) support
				</ul>

				<h4>Sleek Hardware with Great Software</h4><hr>
				<p>After formatting your Micro SD card to EXFAT or FAT32, you will need to <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/tag/rolling-release" target="_blank">download the latest sc64menu.n64</a> and copy it to the root to load the OS on your virgin SD card. Using a PC and card reader to drag and drop whatever you want onto the device and make any folders you wish is very simple, though you can also use the sc64deployer app on PC. The only stipulation is that the 64DD IPL files need to be stored in a folder called "menu".
				<p>Selecting N64 and 64DD ROMs is straight forward, select with A and then load with A, however, playing games like the F-Zero X Expansion Kit requires you to do the following:
				Select the N64 cartridge ROM (F-Zero X [J].n64), back out with B (don't load the game with A), select the F-Zero Exp Kit dump (NUD-EFZJ-JPN.ndd), then hit R to load the pair in tandem. While this works fine and only REALLY applies to F-Zero X and Dezaemon 3D, I still feel that there should be a simpler way to do this, it feels a little clunky in its execution.
				<p>At first, for the life of me, I could not get the thing to connect to my PC, so I couldn't set the RTC or update the firmware. I later found out through <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood" target="_blank">@LuigiBlood</a> that there were specific <a href="https://ftdichip.com/drivers/" target="_blank">Windows drivers</a> required to communicate to the device, and this allowed me to flash the update and sync the RTC to my PC with ease. 
				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest" target="_blank">sc64deployer</a> app is for loading ROMs, updating, backing up, and debug terminal access. It's a command-line app and relies on commands to operate, but luckily, the <a href="https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/blob/main/docs/00_quick_startup_guide.md" target="_blank">SummerCart64 Documentation</a> covers everything you could possibly need to know. All I needed were the commands: "sc64deployer.exe firmware update sc64-firmware-v2.18.1.bin" and "sc64deployer.exe set rtc" to get me where I wanted to be with the device.

				<p>The load speed of ROMs is extremely fast from the SD card, and from my testing: EVERY ROM I threw at it worked perfectly without having to convert a single thing. Games like Morita Shogi 64 and Mario no Photopi are just about the only ones don't work on N64FlashcartMenu yet because they require further individual hardware emulation, but that's the same with any other flashcart out there, including the EverDrive X7. Backing up saves for sharing or modifying also worked brilliantly well and was exceptionally fast!
				<p>As you can see, the SummerCart64 is packed full of features and also includes ROM information with boxart support as well as compatibility for emulators within the N64FlashcartMenu OS. The emulators I used include Neon64 V2 for NES, Sodium64 for SNES, GB64 for Game Boy & Game Boy Color, and TotalSMS for Sega Master System/Game Gear and SG1000 (not currently working)! These emulators worked to a point; the SNES emulator is a little less refined, and there were some layer issues in games like </i>Super Mario All-Stars + World</i> but they played well enough to be enjoyable!</p>
				<p>The SummerCart64 is an incredible device, with blisteringly fast load times, compatibility across all regions for a vast selection of ROMs, plus the ability to play games like F-Zero 64 with the Expansion Kit without the need for the 64DD itself! What's more, the SummerCart64 project is completely open source meaning you will see community improvements, forks, and more, making it truly future-proof.
				<p>Mateusz Faderewski is the creator of SummerCart64's core hardware, firmware, and supporting software, and they have done a truly incredible job here. Bearing in mind that the SC64 began its life as a device for creating homebrew, its an incredibly well rounded package that can do virtually everything!
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Easy to load up & play<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>64DD emulation is a gamechanger<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Compatibility is through the roof!</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Rattly button on the rear (Mena shell version)<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Tiny, fiddly Micro SD slot<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Needs a GUI for PC connectivity</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>The SummerCart64 is a superb addition to any N64 set up thanks to its open-source nature and sub £100 price tag if you build it yourself. The plethora of options and modes available make this a superb developer tool and an astonishingly good flashcart to boot!
			<p>With community created menu themes and styles already popping up, such as a vibrant boxart-heavy <a href="https://github.com/ArthCarvalho/n64menu" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch Online theme</a>, it certainly gives the EverDrive 64 X7 some stiff competition!

				<p>Welcome to ReCollect64 chat Quest64, or should I call you Brian/Mike?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Mike is fine, over the last few months we've become pretty friendly and it's nice to use a name 🙂</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Shall we kick-off this Q&A by describing your Questing antics on social media?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't think I really have a thing anymore to be honest. The overall goal is to make Quest 64 more visible on the internet in a memorable way, but the road to getting there is weird. 
				There are days where I focus on jarring people's memories about the Nintendo 64 and the games outside of the normal Goldeneye/Smash Bros/etc...posts you see all the time. 
				Other days it's talking about the retro gaming discourse and what we can do to improve it for everyone. A lot of times it's just Quest 64 memes and me chasing people around social media with pictures of Brian. 
				I like to keep it fresh.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>When did you get into gaming, any formative recollections?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The first system our family owned was an NES, my parents got it for my brother and I when I was 4/5 (early 89). It was an absolute blast and my Mom was super into it as well, 
				so a lot of my gaming memories and favorite games were ones I shared with her. She is the reason I have such a fondness for Bomberman, as Mega Bomberman on the Sega Genesis was a longtime favorite of hers.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What does your retro gaming collection look like?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have a lot of physical games, though I have been trying to shave my collection down as I get older. There was a point where I probably had between 4000/5000 physical games across all the systems.....
				but as time has passed I've sold/traded some of them to continue building my Nintendo 64 collection (and make more space in my house)</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a favourite console?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>Absolutely! It's the Nintendo 64! Another system my parents bought for me, and one we shared a bunch of memories with....something I'm trying to keep doing with my kids.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What games do you play regularly?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't have a routine for games, though obviously I play Quest 64 quite a bit lol. Most of my game time these days is games my kids want to play, so it's been a lot of ARMS, Animal Crossing, Roblox, Kirby Forgotten Land...and almost always on the Switch. 
				I still play a fair amount of Nintendo 64, but mostly games I didn't grow up with so I can familiarize myself with the entire library more.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What snacks/drinks keep you fuelled for gaming?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>My favorite go to snacks are all banana based. I like peanut butter and banana sandwiches, banana pancakes/bread and smoothies....but for traditional garbage food I'm fond of regular Lay's potato chips and Dr. Pepper. Really anything will do though, I'm a food hole.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have a prized gaming possession?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I don't really thing there's one thing I hold above everything else. I have a fondness for Densha De Go pocket watches, so that's probably the most unique thing in my collection.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Do you have any gaming unicorns left to obtain?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>This one is a moving target for me. There's not one thing I dream about, but when I find out that there's an article I want to read in a hard to find copy of Gamefan magazine or a official N64 soundtrack I've never seen before and isn't online.....
				I tend to get hyper-fixated.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Are you looking forward to Quest64 via N64Recomp?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>YES! The amazing people over at the <a href="https://discord.gg/0Vr8Ym5bLayc1QCP" target="_blank">Quest 64 Speedrun Discord</a> were already working on a traditional decomp of the game, but the new Wiseguy tools are exciting and I hope to see Quest 64 make it's way to PC through a recomp sooner than later!</p></div>

				<p>You’re ordering pizza, you get three toppings, what’s your combo?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I'm traditionally a cheese pizza guy, but if forced to pick three more toppings I would probably do onions, sausage and red chili flakes.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>What’s your most expensive/thrifty retro purchase to date?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>The most expensive game I every purchased was Super Bowling...I think I paid $250USD for it, but that money came from selling a bunch of Guitar Hero guitars during the pandemic to make space in my basement, so it was close to a wash. 
				The most thrifty thing came recently, I spent $1 at a thrift store on a Code Lyoko OST CD that regularly sells for north of $100. Hopefully I'll be trading that soon though as there are lots of people looking for it and that's not really my thing.</p></div>
				<div class="container"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Me.png" alt="Avatar">
				<p>Finally: How many consoles do you own?</p></div>
				<div class="container darker"><img src="Blog/Avatars/Quest64.png" alt="Avatar" class="right">
				<p>I have around 45 consoles but as for games, I have no idea anymore lol. I do have just over 500 N64 games, and the total games across all systems is probably north of 3500-4000. I really should go through and re-catalogue everything but that seems like such a job....especially when I really don't play a lot of them anymore.</p></div>

			<h4>Who Doesn't Love a Bargain?</h4><hr>
			<p>When I saw the QuickShot NitroStick (yes that's what they called it!) for sale recently, at a ridiculously low price of just £5, I jumped at the opportunity to add to my selection of oddball N64 accessories.
			<p>QuickShot made a few accessories in their time and this was perhaps their most specialised piece of input equipment for the N64, specifically having been made for the controlling of aircraft. 
			I dont know if you know this but there are only a handful of "flight-sim" games on the Nintendo 64 including <i>Buck Bumble, Lylat Wars (Star Fox), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, AeroFighters Assault</i> and <i>Pilotwings</i>, so there isn't much to pick from!
			<p>The NitroStick has the Z-Trigger on the rear as you would imagine, the A and B buttons are up on the top of the stick along with a hat-switch that acts as the D-Pad. On your left-hand side are the C-buttons, the L/R triggers in button form and the start/turbo/reset buttons too. 
			Lastly, on the underside resides a switch that converts the input from analog to digital, so if a game requires D-pad input instead of stick input, you're sorted!
			<h4>It's Good, But Not Perfect</h4><hr>
			<p>QuickShot sadly didn't build this thing with games like <i>Lylat Wars</i> in mind, because the pew-pew button is not in the correct pace as you would hope, the Z-Trigger, its on the A button. You cant re-map the buttons either so it feels a little off, but on the other hand games like AeroFighters and even <i>Knife Edge Nosegunner</i> utilise the Z-Trigger for your main guns and it feels superb!
			<p>Handling in-game feels nice, really nice, and the pitch and yaw of this stick really builds the immersion when playing games that best suit this equipment. In actual fact ANY game could theoretically be played with this controller, including <i>Mario Kart 64, Goldeneye,</i> or even <i>Zelda</i> if you REALLY wanted to, but I wouldn't. 
			Barring a couple of these fringe-case flight sims the NitroStick doesn't feel great for RPG/FPS/Platforming play, as the learning curve becomes huge, so stick to the perfectly formed trident-controller for those games!
			<div class="col-container">
			<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Feels great for flight games.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Exceptional precision.</div>
			<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
			<p>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>No remappable buttons.<br>
			<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Limited use for games.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
			<p>It's not for everyone, nor is it for every game, but I kind of like Quickshot's quirky stab at a realistic flight stick.

				<h4>Interesting Retro Tech</h4><hr>
				<p>Not only will this site offer information on your favourite console, I also aim to fill your mind-hole with info on a plethora of accessories and interesting related devices too.</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Accessories/iQue A1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Accessories/iQue A1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Blog/Features/iQue/iQue Box Front.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Blog/Features/iQue/iQue Box Front.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>

				</span>
				<p>In Y2K China's government imposed a ban on games consoles, so Nintendo had to think outside the box to crack the market. The iQue player is an oddity in that it is a console
				that is built into a controller, and it only plays N64 games that have been paid for and downloaded to the memory card. This system was to combat rampant piracy in China, 
				and it worked up until as recently as 2019, when it was hacked by Normmatt, Marshallh, Stuckpixel, Riley/ROL and SUXXORS.</p>
				<p>The iQue had just 14 games available in its life time, these were:
				<ul>
					<li>Animal Crossing<li>Custom Robo<li>Dr. Mario 64<li>Excitebike 64<li>F-Zero X
					<li>Mario Kart 64<li>Paper Mario<li>Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth<li>Star Fox 64
					<li>Super Mario 64<li>Super Smash Bros.<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<li>Wave Race 64<li>Yoshi's Island
				</ul>
				<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask</i> was meant to be release too, which even featured as a screenshot on the iQues box, but it never happened. Additionally a Traditional Chinese Translated 
				version of <i>Ocarina of Time</i> was found ready for release in Taiwan (ROC) but it never happened.</p>
				<h4>A Beautiful Design</h4><hr>
				<p>When I bought mine in 2021 I was elated to have finally got my hands on one of my unicorns (I have a list I'll explain in another post). 
				The console was notably different feeling to an N64 controller, due to the missing middle prong and the more traditional form factor. It was smoother, sleeker heavier, and kind of nice! 
				I booted it up thinking that not a lot would happen, and luckily I had the paired memory card supplied with it. I was buzzing to find not only <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and <i>Dr. Mario</i>, but also <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>OOT</i>!.
				<p>The games are all localised in Chinese and so look incredibly different when they boot up, and I find that fascinating to observe!</p>
				<span align="center" width="100%">
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Super Mario 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Mario Kart 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				<a target="_blank" href="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="Screens/IQUE/Star Fox 64 IQUE S1.png" width="32%" style="padding:auto"/></a>
				</span>
				<p>The iQue could be the ultimate way to play N64 games, for its simplicity and form factor. Nintendo sound definitely revisit this system-on-a-chip model if they ever make an N64 "classic" because it is ideal 
				for pick up and play and the analog stick feels really nice too! The only caveat is lack of multiplayer without an additional device, but these days Nintendo could implement online instead, HDMI out, and possibly let you use your 
				Bluetooth N64 controllers for the Nintendo switch on it for local multiplayer.
				<p>The 64-bit possibilities are endless!

				<h4>When it comes to N64 gaming, what's your ReCollection?</h4><hr>
				<p>I got my console day one, from Toys R Us, after patiently/impatiently waiting on the "if someone doesn't come collect theirs, you're next in line" list. 
				Without thinking, I bagged a console, <i>Super Mario 64</i>, and a green controller, though why I bought a second pad when SM64 clearly wasn't two-player is an enduring mystery.
				<p>I excitedly phoned my friend that evening and told him to come round ASAP to checkout the 3D graphics. The idea of doing homework was thrown to the wayside that night!
				<p>I have great memories of borrowing <i>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</i> and <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> off another friend, swapping out <i>Wave Race 64</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i> for a bit. Turok was one of my first experiences of FPS games, and I loved every blood-soaked second of it!. 
				<p>I was in secondary school when the N64 released, so my friend-group had weekly meet-ups at each other's houses; to share and play whichever games we had purchased. We regularly held 4-8 player tournaments for <i>ISS, Killer Instinct Gold, Lylat Wars, Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>GoldenEye</i> to name but a few. 
				If it was during our lunch breaks: we were guaranteed to be late back to class.
				<p>Almost 30 years on, and I still play these games regularly, and I am now closing in on my attempt to collect a full world set of 388 titles. I have just 11 to go!</p>

				<h4>Why ReCollect64 exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>I found it a minefield to get an app that could let me check off my personal collection, tracking exact versions such as UKV as opposed to EUR or AUS instead of EUU. I have tried to collate as much information as possible into one resource, along with matching images for box art, cart labels, manuals, and accessories. 
				<p>N64 collection apps usually reside as phone apps that don't contain regional variants, every ROM revision, or even correct images to accompany all of them. 
				ReCollect64 aims to change this by bringing images, information, and a full-featured and customisable collection app to any device that has a web browser. 
				<p>N64 will always be my favourite console, and I'm proud to present the next iteration of my passion project, which is now known as ReCollect64! 
				<p>Whether you are reminiscing (recollecting) the nostalgia of the console, or embarking on collecting a specific set (re-collecting): you can use the site to do this and much more! 
				<h4>Why this Blog exists:</h4><hr>
				<p>The ReCollect64 Blog will regularly provide a distinct format with articles centering on the world of N64! 
				<p>Firstly, there will be weekly Q&A chats with prominent faces of the N64 world, giving an easy to read and light-hearted insight into who they are and what they're about!
				I have had a lot of support and plenty of willing victims messaging me to join in with the fun, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I already have more than 10 Q&A chats lined up!				
				<p>Secondly, I will be reviewing games, accessories, and merch relating to the Nintendo 64, both new and old whereever possible. If you have any suggestions or would like me to review something N64 related, my coms are always open (see below).
				<p>Lastly, there will be featured posts that contain news, ReCollect64 site updates, interesting modern developments, or simply reminiscing about the good old days.
				<p>Overall, this is simply a space for sharing neat things, memories and bathing in nostalgia, nothing too heavy. 
				<p>So please bookmark this site, spread the word, and check in from time to time to relax and unwind!
