	<h4>Mako or Breako?</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>The Mako Pad by InterAct is not just a Super Pad variant; it's an entirely different animal. Well, it isn't, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
	<p>The key differences between the two are so minimal that the pad should have had the same titling as the Super Pad 64 Plus, though why it is named "Mako" is a mystery. The Mako Pad 64 only differentiates itself with a clear plastic finish, so you can see the inner workings, and it has slow and turbo fire buttons. Thats it!</p>
	<p>As far as I can tell, the Mako Pad 64 is the name given to the transparent version of the controller in certain regions, whereas the black version, with the slow and turbo buttons, was named the Super Pad 64 Plus outside of those regions. The Super Pad 64 seems to be more common in Western Europe, whereas the Mako Pad 64 looks to have prevailed as far as Oceania and the rest of the world.</p>

	<h4>A Pad By Any Other Name</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Yeah, so the Mako Pad 64 is in essence a Super Pad 64 Plus, so there really is no major comparative difference to the Super Pad 64 to highlight. On the plus side, the controller is well built, and being see-through means there is no hidden hot-glue action within its carcus. On the negative side, the controller suffers the exact same stick-cracking issues as the Super Pad 64, and unfortunately the controller I received has a fracture running up to its plastic nub.</p>
	<p>The controller is great for gaming on; it feels better than it looks (as I mentioned before in my Super Pad 64 review), and it actually handles really nicely across most genres on the system.</p>
	<p>I love the aesthetic; it's "90s modern" and technological looking. It's also hugely nostalgic of the times when this was on trend, and I love it!</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Transparent shell<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Same comfortable grip<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Same button placement<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Slow & Turbo buttons</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Sub-par stick and D-pad</br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Stick also cracks over time</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I picked this one up for £10 on eBay just two weeks ago, and it arrived with a cracked stick. Luckily, you can wiggle the plastic cap off, glue it, and pop it back on to avoid it cracking any further in the future. Overall, this is the exact same pad as the Super Pad 64, just with a transluscent shell and slow/turbo functions!</p>
