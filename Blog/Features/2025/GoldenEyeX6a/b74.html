	<p>Today <a href="https://x.com/GoldeneyeMods" target="_blank">GoldeneyeMods</a>, aka Wreck from <a href="http://n64vault.com/wiki:pd-multi-levels" target="_blank">N64Vault.com</a> has released the much anticipated GoldenEye X 6a update patch!</p>
	<p>Using <i>Perfect Dark</i> as a basis, <i>GoldenEye X</i> is a mod that ports over all the <i>GoldenEye 007</i> multiplayer modes, weapons, characters, and arenas into the updated engine, along with a few more surprises. The project began with the first version back in 2010, and has now seen 11 incremental releases <a href="http://n64vault.com/historical-tools:goldeneye-x-archives" target="_blank">(1a/2a/3a/4a/5a/5b/5c/5c-i/5d and 5e), including the release of 6a</a>.</p>
	<p>The previous patch, version 5e, was released on December 25th, 2016, and no, your eyes do not decieve you, it was over eight years ago! That version brought us features such as the return of the slapper (as opposed to the punch animation in <i>Perfect Dark</i>), new mission levels, and even the VR level; Icicle Pyramid level from <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>!</p>
	<p>Patch 6a, which was initially teased on January the 5th, 2024, was then relatively silent until it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oboqWNvLtck" target="_blank">shown off in full on December 23rd, 2024, in a three hour live stream</a> by <a href="https://x.com/Graslu00" target="_blank">Graslu00</a> on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjywMQn0t-4" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, promises more of the same but with plenty of QOL features including 007 mode, enhanced dialogue, new back areas within certain levels, more single player missions, and enhanced cooperative and multiplayer modes.</p> 
	<p>Here are the full release notes for patch 6a:</p>

	<b>GE-X Patch 6a: 01-19-25</b>
	<p>It's been a little over eight years since the last GoldenEye X patch (version 5e) was released. I know a lot of people had either given up on the project already, or were on the verge of it. Thought that it was dead in the water, and anything shown of more recent progress was only a tease of something they'd never get to play. Well, here we are. GE-X patch 6a is now yours to play. I appreciate those who have stuck with it, and were always encouraging. Even those who made comments about it not coming out, you still had enough interest in it to vent frustration, which I can understand. But anyway, let's talk about this update.</p>
	<p>Last time around, there were three missions that were (pretty much) fully functional. Those included Silo, Frigate and Egypt. In this patch, there are now nine. That's an additional six levels, as well as updates to the previously released trio. The Runway, Bunker i, Bunker ii, Archives, Caverns and Aztec can all be played from start to finish, while also being supported in the cooperative and counter-operative modes. That's nearly half of GoldenEye's campaign thus far. As well, the Dam map has made its way in. This was a tricky one to get going, and does still need work, but it's a good start. You're now given a choice to place female characters into certain missions; scientists in Silo and Caverns, and Moonraker Elites in Aztec. These models were only available in the multiplayer portion of the game before, but can show up during the campaign if you want them to. While in the MI6 Headquarters hub (Carrington Institute), go into the pause menu to find the "Disable Female NPCs" option under the Video section. Either selection does not affect Natalya or Xenia. Also, under the Audio menu, there's an option to allow bonus dialogue to play. Most of these lines are from 007, and typically reference objectives or locations. Don't want them? Simply turn it off. As these two things are totally new to the game, and may be unwelcomed by some, I wanted to make sure the player had control over each.</p>
	<p>The multiplayer portion of the mod (Virtual Reality) doesn't have a lot of new content, but did see some quality improvements. Two new levels have been added, however. These include Archives Backzone (replacing Archives 1st Floor), and the classic GoldenEye custom mission map Cliff Base. Weapon layouts were improved, which allows assortments such as Pistols and Golden Gun to better mimic how they were originally. Elf is the latest bonus character, as Old Saint Nick needed to call into the North Pole for some backup. As well, the thirty VR Assignments are still present.</p>
	<p>For greater details on what's been added or changed since the previous patch, please refer to the changelog text file inside the download zip.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, or other concerns, check out the FAQs text file. If what you are looking for is not listed, you can contact me (Wreck) by either of a few different methods: The GoldenEye Mods Twitter/X page, the Shooters Forever Message Board, or the N64 Vault Discord server. There is even a thread specifically for GE-X discussion under the #ge-pd-editing channel.</p>
	<p>Again, my apologies for the various delays over the years. I sincerely hope the next release is only a small fraction of that time. Enjoy the mod!</p>
