	<p>Welcome to the 5th N64brew Game Jam! Compete against other players and teams to make an N64 game and help out a charity!<br></br>The competition starts October 13th, and ends December 13th. The winner will be announced on December 20th (subject to delays).</p>

	<p>With <i>Super Mario Party Jamboree</i>, the latest in the <i>Mario Party</i> series of games, having just been released on October 17th for Nintendo Switch, it seems apt that the multiplayer theme has been chosen because the first three <i>Mario Party</i> games originated on the N64 between 1999 and 2001!</p>
	<p>The competition allows you to work individually or as part of a team, and the community will vote to choose a winner around December 20th, 2024 (subject to delays). Entrants need to produce four-player games and can submit multiple entries; however,  the main stipulation is that you must use <a href="https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon" target="_blank">Libdragon open-source SDK</a> to produce your game.</p>

	<p>The prize pool sits at $1250 currently and is constantly being added to via generous donations. The winners will be able to donate the final sum of money to the charity of their choosing when the competition ends.</p>
	<p>Keep your eyes peeled on ReCollect64 for updates on this contest, because I will be monitoring submissions as and when they appear!</p>
