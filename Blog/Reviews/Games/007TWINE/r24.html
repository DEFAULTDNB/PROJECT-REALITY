	<h4>The Name's Bond</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When <i>GoldenEye 007</i> was released in 1997, it kickstarted something that hadn't been seen in the industry before: good movie tie-ins. Prior to Pierce Brosnan's first folly as the titular MI6 agent, there were very few games that were based on TV shows or movies that were in any way, shape, or form as good as the reference material from which they came. EA took up the mantle with the Brosnan's second outing in <i>007 The World is Not Enough</i> (TWINE) in the year 2000, and they had huge boots to fill, but did they manage it?</p>
	<p>The first thing you'll notice about TWINE is the addition of voice acting. Where Rare's <i>GoldenEye 007</i> opted for gameplay over cinematics, EA wanted to push the boat out a little further and pair gunplay with scripted sequences, more gadgets, and slightly fiddlier gameplay.</p>
	<p>The World is Not Enough puts you in the covertly stealthy boots of Bond but tends to drop you off in places that put you front and center. Following on from the movie's story beats, you openly rob a bank, chases villains around cities, skulk around the London Underground, swim through sunken submarines, ski around a mountain, and explore active volcanoes, you know; that sort of thing.</p>
	<p>The voice acting and music certainly add something to the gameplay, but in my opinion it also detracts from the action. Sound effects in general sound great, with gun sounds and explosions hitting nicely, but the acting sounds very stiff, even if it is coming from the real-life stars of the movie like Judi Dench, Pierce Brosnan, or John Cleese. Also, where is the trademark James Bond jingle? I didn't hear it once!</p>

	<h4>Shaken and Stirred</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>TWINE bounces you from location to location, intertwined with short cinematics and some very stiff voice acting. The main meat of the gameplay comes from the game engine itself, which Eurocom tweaked to deliver the best performance on the N64 producing steller framerates and solid action.</p>
	<p>When playing the game, you'll notice a distinct style of drawing you into a certain area before spawning enemies. The game feels like it was built to be on rails; it has that <i>Virtua Cop</i> vibe to it, even more so than <i>GoldenEye</i> does, and that was famously converted from a rail shooter to be free-roaming during its initial development at Rare.</p>
	<p>One thing it does do right is stir together a heady mixture of gadgets, secondary fire modes, and objectives across the three main difficulties. The environments and scenery all look superb throughout, with recognisable locations nicely lit with additional effects such as reflections, fire, sprinklers, and fog giving you additional challenges to overcome. I really like the detail that has gone into the environments; there are so many varied rooms, textures, and places to snoop around that the game doesn't get repetitive to explore.</p>
	<p>The obvious thing that Eurocom hasn't done right is the enemy intelligence. Each bad guy is very wooden in their movement, and they each have little to no strategy going on behind their eyes. They don't flank, react, or attack as realistically as you would have hoped, and as such, each replay of the levels plays out extremely similarly.</p>
	<p>Another thing is that one of the levels, the skiing one set in an environment dangerously similar to "surface" from GE007, is entirely on-rails, with no freedom of movement whatsoever. Perhaps more levels were set to be like this, but for just one to be so restrictive makes little sense in a game that is 99% explorable.</p>
	<p>You can complete the game in a little over an hour, but that's just the single-player campaign; the multiplayer is where the dynamic and frenetic fun is at. Though not quite as engaging as comparable shooters, this one does its best with what it has, and even the addition of bots, which should be joyous, is again let down by poor AI within humdrum modes.</p>

	<h4>Fussy Galore</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>If it came to a showdown of features between <i>GoldenEye</i> and <i>The World is Not Enough</i>, then TWINE comes fully loaded with 14 campaign levels, 22 weapons, 18 gadgets, and 14 multiplayer arenas (plus three additional unlockable), but <i>GoldenEye</i> hammers harder with 18 (plus two additional secret levels) and packs 11 multiplayer arenas and 22 weapons. It's worth bearing in mind that <i>GoldenEye 007</i> came out almost a full three years earlier than <i>TWINE</i>, but yet Eurocom borrows heavily from GE's influence.</p>
	<p>TWINE adds in a lot more gadgetry, including the grappling hook and night vision goggles, more varied missions with mechanics like swimming and skiing on-rails, and encourages you to engage in stealthy actions over all out gunplay.</p>
	<p>Overall the game definitely attempts to differentiate itself from <i>GoldenEye</i>, but with such a high bar set by Rare's elite team, it was inevitable that comparisons would be drawn between the two. GE007 outranks TWINE in almost every scenario here, including AI, multiplayer, and replayability.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Strong story mode campaign.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>A huge arsenal of weapons & gadgets.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Decent multiplayer included.</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p></p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Wooden acting and stiff animations.<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Enemy AI is extremely questionable.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>It's a solid game, but personally, I don't think that <i>The World is Not Enough</i> could ever dethrone <i>GoldenEye</i> for the top spot in terms of James Bond-themed first person shooters for the N64, but it does a stellar job in giving players another outing as 007, and pours everything it has into its modes and unlockables.</p>
	<p>Definitely worth picking up and playing through that campaign, especially if you want to engage in more multiplayer carnage with friends.</p>
