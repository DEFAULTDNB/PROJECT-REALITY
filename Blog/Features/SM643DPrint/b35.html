	<h4>Printable Perfection</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Daniel Lyell over on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/888801488357060" target="_blank">Nintendo 64 Facebook group</a> recently shared their latest 3D printable project, Peach's Castle from <i>Super Mario 64</i>!</p>
	<p>What drew me to this project the most was not only the exceptional attention to detail and overall scale of the castle, but the ReCollect64-worthy story behind it:</p>

		<p>An absolute Hallmark in modern 3D Platforming, Mario 64 is one of my fondest gaming memories, So I wanted to recreate the Entry point for the game, with some small creative liberties to include the Courtyard into one single Diorama.</p>

	<p>Peach's Castle is a highly iconic environment that every N64 owner knows like the back of their hands. This diorama encapsulates the architecture in its entirety, complete with the warp pipe, waterfall, pond, moat, courtyard, and castle itself.</p>
	<p>Openable in Bamboo Studio or downloadable as 3MF/STL/CAD files, these prints come complete with timings ranging from 14.4 hours to 45 hours to complete, the number of PLA plates required, and how much PLA and which colours the project will use.</p>
	<p>The build also comes with a comprehensive 11 step guide, along with notes, indicating how to construct it properly and make it fit together in a cinch!</p>
	<p>Daniel, aka Arniel86, has a page over at	<a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/672415#profileId-600279" target="_blank">Maker World</a> full of projects that are free for anyone to download and print. I highly recommend that you take some time to check them out, especially if you have a 3D printer and are itching to print some N64 nostalgia!</p>

	<h4>Nostalgic Nozzles</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>I spoke to Daniel briefly to get a little more information regarding costing and time to print, and he mentioned that the main full-scale print takes around 15.3 hours (plus filament changes and exchanging plates), would cost approximately 11-12 AUD (£6 GBP) for half a roll of filament (430 grams) and a little bit for the electricity used to run the machine for the required amount of hours. Total costing is roughly  15 AUD (£8 GBP) to make this magnificent model, provided you already own a 3D printer, plates and nozzels. Making the smaller scale prints requires a smaller nozzel for the fine details and therefore takes a little longer to print.</p>
	<p>Incredibly, Daniel has also already printed the battle course maps from <i>Mario Kart 64</i> on his profile over at <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/622350#profileId-546491" target="_blank">Maker World</a> and he has also designed some handy <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/585587#profileId-506787" target="_blank">console display stands</a> too!</p>
	<p>When it comes to 3D printing, the world is truly your oyster. As long as you have the ability to obtain or create the models, slice them up, and the knowledge to be able to successfully print them out; you could probably make any character or scene from any game your heart desires!
