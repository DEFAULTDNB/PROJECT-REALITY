	<h4>A Sharks Tale</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>Recently I performed a short analysis on the <a href="blog.html#b5" target="_blank">N64's catalogue</a> and noted that of the 388 titles, there are 36 fighting games. That accounts for nearly 10% of the Nintendo 64's entire library, and so it makes sense that none other than InterAct would jump at the opportunity to make a peripheral for the 64-bit wonder.
	<p>The InterAct Arcade Shark does exactly what it says on the tin: it's an arcade stick in all of its form and function and doesn't attempt to be anything else!
	<p>Conceived in 1996, the N64 wouldn't exactly have had too may games around the time of launch. <i>War Gods, Ki Gold, MK Trilogy</i>, and perhaps even the lacklustre <i>MK Mythologies Sub-Zero</i> would have been all that was available in the first year, so it was slim pickings until 1997, when MK4 and Mace the Dark Ages arrived. 1998 was even better for fighting games, with the likes of <i>Fighters Destiny, Bio F.R.E.A.Ks, G.A.S.P.</i>, and <i>Flying Dragon</i> appeared. It wasn't until midway through the N64's lifespan, 1999, that the first installment of the wildly popular fighting series <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> was released.
	<p>I managed to bag mine a few months ago after lusting after one for many years. For the pincely sum of £34.99, I won a boxed one in immaculate condition, and with PriceCharting stating that the current loose price averages £31 and a boxed price circles roughly £89, I was pretty pleased with my purchase!
	<p>Being that this was produced in 1996, I can verify that this sadly doesn't work with a Rumble Pak. I tried plugging it in to a compatible game and it just sent the analog stick doolally.

	<h4>Fresher than a Thresher</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>With titles such as the four <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games, <i>Killer Instinct Gold, Super Smash Bros.</i> and <i>Fighters Destiny</i> at the fore of the N64's fighting roster, there are some real bangers on the system.
	<p>I tested out the aforementioned titles, and I have to say the Arcade Shark is a pretty fierce piece of kit, but I have a few qualms. The buttons feel great, but they're not raised enough on the C-Buttons, it would have been great to have all of the face buttons given the same treatment, just coloured appropriately. Instead we have the A and B buttons along with the L, R, and Z buttons standing proud like real arcade buttons, whereas the C-Button cluster is markedly smaller and flatter. The net result is that your fingers gravitate towards the L and R buttons, which, in <i>KI Gold</i> and most fighting games on N64, do nothing.
	<p>Other games fare similarly with the same button-feel issues rearing their heads. Perhaps it's a matter of muscle memory, and perhaps I need to throw a lot more time into fighting games (I rarely play them), but as a casual device, I found those C-Buttons a bit annoying.
	<p>The stick is great, it's responsive, and it works across both the D-Pad and analog stick slots, but, and this is a big but, the stick tended to twist loose during play. I had to really screw it in hard to prevent any movement, because in the heat of a fighting game you really do push those little ball-top sticks to their upper limits, and you tend to unknowingly tilt harder when under the pump.
	<p>Don't get me wrong, the stick feels great, but it needed a little refining to be perfect. The fact that only one stick is supplied is also a possible issue. A spare is always welcome, but would you ever need to plug two in at once? The sensible answer is no, but the inquisitive answer is; it would have been cool to have the option. 
	<p>No game really sees you switching from stick to D-Pad and back again, so it's a moot point, however, were you to play a game like <i>Mario Kart 64</i> and want to steer with one and flick the other to adjust your camera or the HUD, it would have been nice. As it stands, the circular base you screw the stick into can be used as a flat D-Pad or analog stick without the stick plugged in, which is handy.
	<p>I suppose this is a better method than having just one stick slot and a switch to swap the D-Pad function to analog stick or vice versa, but the downside of that idea is that you couldn't use the screw in stick in the middle position to make the entire pad work more comfortably for smaller hands in all games.
	<p>The Arcade Shark is oversized, and it weighs well over a kilo, so it's best to use it on a surface rather than your lap for best effect, unless you enjoy dead legs.

	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>InterAct's Arcade Shark hits hard as a fight stick, but has a few annoying traits. If you're a fan of the fighting genre then this is a great purchase to really get the coin-op experience from the utra hardware, but if you're thinking about using it on any other genre of game, think again.
