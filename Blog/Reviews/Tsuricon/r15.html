	<h4>Fishing for Compliments</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>When the N64 initially came out, the only fishing I was interested in was the <i>Ocarina of Time</i> minigame. I used to really enjoy trying to get the 19-LB lunker and, of course, obtaining that elusive heart piece!</p>
	<p>It never occurred to me as a teenager that dedicated fishing games existed, they weren't even a blip on my radar until a mate got the Dreamcast with <i>Sega Bass Fishing</i> and a fishing rod controller! We played that game a lot in 1999, but it still wasn't a high priority for me to fish on my N64, probably because I didn't have a fishing controller for it, and most of the fishing games would have been costly Japanese imports.</p>
	<p>The N64 only had a small number of dedicated fishing games, including <i>Nushi Tsuri 64, Nushi Tsuri 64 Shiokaze Ninotte, In-Fisherman Bass Hunter 64, Bass Masters 2000, and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1</i>, the latter of which received its own dedicated controller!</p>
	<p>The Ascii Tsurikon 64 (or Tsuricon 64) is an N64 controller in the shape of a fishing rod, but it also encapsulates a real-feel reel with adjustable drag, rumble via 2xAA batteries, and a motion sensor that is triggered when casting and setting the hook!</p>
	<p>It wasn't the only aquatic peripheral around, but it was definitely the most realistic looking and the most difficult to get your hands on, as it was a Japanese exclusive.</p>

	<h4>Reely Al-luring</h4>
	<div class="titleUnderline"></div>
	<p>This controller was primarily designed for Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 but can function on the other fishing titles too with basic controls. In Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1, the reel even has a realistic clicky nature to it, and the whole device simulates the feel of fishing with a rod beautifully.</p>
	<p>The rod pad feels great in hand; it's balanced and intuitive to use. The C-buttons are in a rubbery concave configuration, which is odd at first but suits the game perfectly. The other buttons are also well placed; a lot of care and attention has gone into the ergonomics of this controller, and it pays dividends while in-game.</p>
	<p>I'm also glad of the decision to anchor the controller's cable at the bottom of the controller, rather than the top, because the temptation to *thwhip* the cable around your living room would be phenominal and dangerous. So dangerous.</p>
	<p>Sadly, the Tsurikon 64 doesn't have all the normal buttons an OG controller has. It is missing the D-Pad and the L button, which means some other non-fishing titles cannot be played on this quirky controller. Barring those, you're free to play games like <i>Mario Kart 64</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i> on it regardless!</p>
	<p>As a peripheral, its so niche! It's plainly not designed for use on any old game, but it's perfect, and I mean flawless in its design of simulating a fishing rod. When it came out in 1999, it retailed for ¥5800, which is just £30. Nowadays the Tsurikon costs upwards of £60-£80 depending on condition, and even then it is usually unboxed.</p>

	<div class="pro"><strong> The Pros:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Satisfyingly clicky reel<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Built in rumble<br>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Sensor for casting</div>
	<div class="con"><strong> The Cons:</strong>
	<p>
	<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark">&nbsp;</i>Not all fishing games support the reel or sensor!</div>
	</div>
	<div class="verdict"><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
	<p>I only managed to obtain one of these recently, and it came unboxed with a free copy of Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1. but now I wish I had had one years ago when they were fresh and new!</p>
	<p>Ascii's Tsurikon is a novel input device that does exactly what it says on the tin. Fishing enthusiasts will unquestionably fall in love with this device hook, line, and sinker!</p>
